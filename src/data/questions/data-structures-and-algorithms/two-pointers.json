Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\nTo solve the **Trapping Rain Water** problem using the two pointers technique, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Problem Recap\n\nGiven an array `height` representing the elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n\n### Two Pointers Approach\n\n1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**  \n   - `left` at the start (`0`)\n   - `right` at the end (`n - 1`)\n\n2. **Track Maximum Heights:**  \n   - `left_max` to track the highest bar from the left\n   - `right_max` to track the highest bar from the right\n\n3. **Iterate While `left < right`:**\n   - At each step, compare `height[left]` and `height[right]`.\n   - If `height[left] < height[right]`:\n     - If `height[left] >= left_max`, update `left_max`.\n     - Else, water trapped at `left` is `left_max - height[left]`.\n     - Move `left` pointer to the right.\n   - Else:\n     - If `height[right] >= right_max`, update `right_max`.\n     - Else, water trapped at `right` is `right_max - height[right]`.\n     - Move `right` pointer to the left.\n\n4. **Sum Up the Water Trapped at Each Step.**\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef trap(height):\n    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1\n    left_max, right_max = 0, 0\n    water = 0\n\n    while left < right:\n        if height[left] < height[right]:\n            if height[left] >= left_max:\n                left_max = height[left]\n            else:\n                water += left_max - height[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            if height[right] >= right_max:\n                right_max = height[right]\n            else:\n                water += right_max - height[right]\n            right -= 1\n    return water\n```\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- The amount of water trapped at each position depends on the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right.\n- By moving the pointers inward and updating the maximums, you efficiently calculate trapped water in a single pass with O(n) time and O(1) space.\n\n---\n\nThis approach is optimal and widely used for the Trapping Rain Water problem.",

    "answer": "```markdown To merge two sorted arrays using the two pointers technique, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize two pointers**: Start with one pointer at the beginning of each array.\n2. **Compare elements**: At each step, compare the elements pointed to by the two pointers.\n3. **Add the smaller element**: Append the smaller element to the result array and move that pointer forward.\n4. **Continue until one array is exhausted**: Repeat the comparison and appending until you reach the end of one array.\n5. **Append remaining elements**: Add any remaining elements from the other array to the result.\n\n### Example in Python\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    merged = []\n    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            merged.append(arr1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(arr2[j])\n            j += 1\n    # Append remaining elements\n    merged.extend(arr1[i:])\n    merged.extend(arr2[j:])\n    return merged\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 3, 5]\narr2 = [2, 4, 6]\nprint(merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Both arrays must be sorted for this technique to work efficiently.\n- The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays.\n- This approach is commonly used in the merge step of the Merge Sort algorithm.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Scenario Where Both Pointers Move in the Same Direction\n\nA common scenario where both pointers move in the same direction is the **sliding window technique**. This approach is often used to solve problems involving subarrays or substrings, such as finding the longest substring without repeating characters or the smallest subarray with a sum greater than a target value.\n\n#### Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n\nIn this problem, we use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window of characters being considered. Both pointers start at the beginning of the string and move to the right:\n\n- The `right` pointer expands the window by moving forward one character at a time.\n- The `left` pointer also moves forward (when necessary) to shrink the window and maintain the condition (no repeating characters).\n\n**Pseudocode:**\n```python\nleft = 0\nfor right in range(len(s)):\n    while s[right] in current_window:\n        remove s[left] from current_window\n        left += 1\n    add s[right] to current_window\n    update max_length if needed\n```\n\n**Key Point:**  \nBoth `left` and `right` pointers only move forward (to the right), never backward. This ensures that the window always progresses through the array or string in a single pass, making the algorithm efficient.\n\n---\n\nThis pattern is widely applicable in array and string problems where you need to examine contiguous segments efficiently.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\nA common scenario where two pointers move towards each other is when solving problems that require checking pairs of elements from both ends of a sorted array. For example, in the **Two Sum II** problem, you are given a sorted array and need to find two numbers that add up to a target value.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n- Initialize one pointer at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.\n- Calculate the sum of the elements at both pointers.\n- If the sum is equal to the target, you’ve found the answer.\n- If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.\n- If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.\n- Continue this process until the pointers meet.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\narr = [1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 15\nleft, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n\nwhile left < right:\n    curr_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]\n    if curr_sum == target:\n        print(f\"Pair found: {arr[left]}, {arr[right]}\")\n        break\n    elif curr_sum < target:\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right -= 1\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis \"moving towards each other\" technique is efficient for problems involving pairs in sorted arrays, such as finding pairs with a specific sum or checking for palindromes.",

    "answer": "```markdown Two pointers are a powerful technique for solving various linked list problems efficiently. The idea is to use two references (often called slow and fast pointers) that traverse the list at different speeds or start at different positions. Here’s how two pointers can be used in common linked list scenarios:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Detecting a Cycle\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  Use a slow pointer that moves one node at a time and a fast pointer that moves two nodes at a time.  \n- **Logic:**  \n  If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer inside the cycle.\n\n```python\ndef hasCycle(head):\n    slow = fast = head\n    while fast and fast.next:\n        slow = slow.next\n        fast = fast.next.next\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Finding the Middle of a Linked List\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  Use slow and fast pointers.  \n- **Logic:**  \n  The fast pointer moves two steps for every one step of the slow pointer.

Removing the N-th Node from the End\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  Use two pointers with a gap of n nodes between them.  \n- **Logic:**  \n  Move the first pointer n steps ahead, then move both pointers until the first reaches the end. The second pointer will be at the node before the one to remove.\n\n```python\ndef removeNthFromEnd(head, n):\n    dummy = ListNode(0, head)\n    first = second = dummy\n    for _ in range(n + 1):\n        first = first.next\n    while first:\n        first = first.next\n        second = second.next\n    second.next = second.next.next\n    return dummy.next\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Problem                          | Pointer Movement                    | Result                        |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Detect Cycle                     | Slow: 1 step, Fast: 2 steps         | Meet if cycle exists          |\n| Find Middle                      | Slow: 1 step, Fast: 2 steps         | Slow at middle                |\n| Remove N-th from End             | First: n+1 steps ahead of Second    | Second at node before target  |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nTwo pointers help traverse linked lists in clever ways, enabling efficient solutions to problems that would otherwise require extra space or multiple passes.",

Here’s how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialize two pointers**: `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the string.\n2. **Use a set** to keep track of characters in the current window (substring).\n3. **Expand the window** by moving the `right` pointer forward:\n    - If the character at `right` is not in the set, add it and update the maximum length.\n    - If the character is already in the set, remove the character at `left` from the set and move `left` forward.\n4. **Repeat** until `right` reaches the end of the string.\n\n---\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:\n    char_set = set()\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n    \n    return max_length\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- Both pointers (`left` and `right`) define the current window.\n- The set ensures all characters in the window are unique.\n- When a duplicate is found, increment `left` and remove characters until the duplicate is gone.\n- The window always contains unique characters, and you keep track of the maximum window size.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- **O(n)**, where n is the length of the string, since each character is visited at most twice (once by `right`, once by `left`).\n\n---\n\nThis two pointers (sliding window) technique efficiently finds the longest substring without repeating characters.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\nTo solve the **Minimum Window Substring** problem using two pointers, you can use the **sliding window** technique. The idea is to maintain a window (using two pointers, usually called left and right) that contains all the required characters from the target string, and then try to minimize the size of this window.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize pointers and data structures:**\n   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the string.\n   - Use a hash map or array to count the frequency of characters in the target string.\n   - Use another hash map to keep track of the characters in the current window.\n\n2. **Expand the window:**\n   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, expanding the window.\n   - For each character at `right`, update the window's character count.\n\n3. **Check if the window is valid:**\n   - After each expansion, check if the window contains all characters of the target string with the required frequency.\n\n4. **Contract the window:**\n   - If the window is valid, move the `left` pointer to the right to try and reduce the window size while still maintaining all required characters.\n   - Update the minimum window size and starting index if a smaller valid window is found.\n\n5. **Repeat:**\n   - Continue expanding and contracting until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef minWindow(s, t):\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    need = Counter(t)\n    window = {}\n    have, need_count = 0, len(need)\n    res, res_len = [-1, -1], float('inf')\n    left = 0\n\n    for right, char in enumerate(s):\n        window[char] = window.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n        if char in need and window[char] == need[char]:\n            have += 1\n\n        while have == need_count:\n            # Update result\n            if (right - left + 1) < res_len:\n                res = [left, right]\n                res_len = right - left + 1\n\n            # Pop from the left of the window\n            window[s[left]] -= 1\n            if s[left] in need and window[s[left]] < need[s[left]]:\n                have -= 1\n            left += 1\n\n    l, r = res\n    return s[l:r+1] if res_len != float('inf') else \"\"\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- The two pointers define the current window.\n- Expand the window by moving `right`, and contract by moving `left`.\n- Use hash maps to efficiently check if the window is valid.\n- This approach ensures an optimal O(N) time complexity.\n\n---",

    "answer": "```markdown **Limitations of the Two Pointers Technique**\n\nThe two pointers technique is a powerful tool for solving array and string problems efficiently, but it has several limitations:\n\n1. **Requires Sorted or Specially Structured Data**  \n   - The technique is most effective when the data is sorted or has a structure that allows meaningful pointer movement. For unsorted or unstructured data, two pointers may not work efficiently.\n\n2. **Not Suitable for All Problems**  \n   - It is mainly used for problems involving searching for pairs, triplets, or subarrays with certain properties (e.g., sum, difference). Problems that require random access or complex relationships between elements may not benefit from this technique.\n\n3. **Limited to Linear Data Structures**  \n   - Two pointers are typically used with arrays or linked lists. They are less applicable to trees, graphs, or other non-linear data structures.\n\n4. **Difficulties with Duplicates and Edge Cases**  \n   - Handling duplicates or special edge cases (like overlapping pointers or empty arrays) can complicate implementation and may require additional logic.\n\n5. **Not Always Optimal**  \n   - In some cases, other algorithms (like hashing or binary search) may provide better time or space complexity.\n\n6. **Limited to Problems with Monotonic Movement**  \n   - The technique works best when pointers can move in a single direction (left to right or right to left) without backtracking.

    "question": "How can you use two pointers with binary search?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced explanation of how two pointers can be used with binary search:\n\n---\n\n## Using Two Pointers with Binary Search\n\nThe **two pointers** technique and **binary search** are both powerful tools for solving array and string problems efficiently. While they are often used separately, combining them can solve certain advanced problems, especially when searching for pairs or ranges that satisfy specific conditions.\n\n### Common Scenarios\n\n#### 1. Two Pointers to Find a Pair, Binary Search for the Second Pointer\n\nSuppose you want to find if there exists a pair `(i, j)` in a sorted array such that `arr[i] + arr[j] == target`. The classic two pointers approach works, but you can also fix one pointer and use binary search for the other:\n\n```python\ndef pair_with_sum(arr, target):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        complement = target - arr[i]\n        # Binary search for complement in arr[i+1:]\n        left, right = i + 1, n - 1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if arr[mid] == complement:\n                return True\n            elif arr[mid] < complement:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n```\n\n#### 2. Binary Search for Window Size, Two Pointers for Validation\n\nFor problems like \"find the smallest window/length that satisfies a condition,\" you can use binary search on the window size and two pointers to check if any window of that size is valid.\n\n**Example:** Find the minimum length subarray with sum ≥ `S`.\n\n```python\ndef min_subarray_len(arr, S):\n    n = len(arr)\n    left, right = 1, n\n    answer = 0\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        # Use two pointers to check if any window of size mid has sum >= S\n        window_sum = sum(arr[:mid])\n        found = window_sum >= S\n        for i in range(mid, n):\n            window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - mid]\n            if window_sum >= S:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            answer = mid\n            right = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return answer\n```\n\n### Key Patterns\n\n- **Fix one pointer, binary search the other:** Useful when the array is sorted and you want to optimize the search for a complement or range.\n- **Binary search on answer, two pointers for checking:** Useful for \"minimum/maximum window\" problems, where you binary search the possible answer and use two pointers to check feasibility.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Technique                              | Use Case                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Two pointers + binary search            | Find pairs/ranges efficiently in sorted data|\n| Binary search on window, two pointers   | Optimize window/range size problems         |\n\n---\n\n**In essence:**  \nYou can combine two pointers and binary search by either using binary search to optimize one pointer's movement, or by using two pointers to validate a condition inside a binary search loop. This hybrid approach is especially effective for advanced array and string problems.",

Here’s an advanced-level explanation in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## Using Two Pointers on Circular Arrays\n\nTwo pointers is a powerful technique for solving array problems efficiently. When applied to **circular arrays**—arrays where the end connects back to the start—the approach requires careful handling of indices to simulate the \"wrap-around\" behavior.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Circular Array:** An array where after the last element, you return to the first element (i.e., index `(i + 1) % n`).\n- **Two Pointers:** Typically, `start` and `end` (or `left` and `right`) traverse the array to maintain a window or search for a condition.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers:**  \n   Set both pointers (e.g., `start` and `end`) to valid positions, often both at 0.\n\n2. **Traverse with Modulo:**  \n   When moving pointers, use modulo operation to wrap around:\n   ```python\n   end = (end + 1) % n\n   start = (start + 1) % n\n   ```\n\n3. **Window Size Control:**  \n   To avoid infinite loops, keep track of the number of elements processed. For a window of size `k`, ensure you don't exceed `n` elements.\n\n4. **Termination Condition:**  \n   Since the array is circular, a common pattern is to stop when `start` returns to its original position or after `n` steps.\n\n### Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size k in a Circular Array\n\n```python\ndef max_circular_subarray_sum(arr, k):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if k > n:\n        return None\n\n    # Compute initial window sum\n    window_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(k))\n    max_sum = window_sum\n\n    # Slide the window over the circular array\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Remove the element going out and add the new element coming in\n        window_sum = window_sum - arr[(i - 1) % n] + arr[(i + k - 1) % n]\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)\n\n    return max_sum\n```\n\n### Tips\n\n- **Infinite Loops:** Always ensure you have a clear stopping condition.\n- **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the window size is greater than the array size.\n- **Applications:** Problems like finding subarrays with a given sum, maximum/minimum sum subarrays, or detecting cycles can be adapted to circular arrays using this technique.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step                | Regular Array | Circular Array                |\n|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| Move pointer        | `i += 1`     | `i = (i + 1) % n`             |\n| Window boundaries   | `i < n`      | `count < n` or `i != start`   |\n| Access element      | `arr[i]`     | `arr[i % n]`                  |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nUse modulo arithmetic to move pointers and access elements, carefully manage window size and stopping conditions, and always consider edge cases unique to the circular nature of the array.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level explanation in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## Using Two Pointers to Solve Interval Overlap Problems\n\nTwo pointers is a powerful technique for efficiently solving interval overlap problems, especially when dealing with sorted intervals. The core idea is to iterate through two (or more) lists of intervals simultaneously, leveraging their sorted order to detect overlaps without redundant comparisons.\n\n### General Approach\n\n1. **Sort the Intervals:**  \n   If not already sorted, sort the interval lists by their start times.\n\n2. **Initialize Pointers:**  \n   Use two pointers (e.g., `i` and `j`), each starting at the beginning of their respective interval lists.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compare:**  \n   At each step, compare the current intervals from both lists:\n   - Let `A[i] = [startA, endA]` and `B[j] = [startB, endB]`.\n   - The intervals overlap if `startA <= endB` and `startB <= endA`.\n\n4. **Process Overlap:**  \n   - If they overlap, process the intersection (e.g., add `[max(startA, startB), min(endA, endB)]` to the result).\n   - Move the pointer with the smaller end time forward (since it cannot overlap with any future interval from the other list).\n\n5. **Continue Until One List is Exhausted.**\n\n### Example: Find All Overlapping Intervals\n\nSuppose you have two lists of intervals, `A` and `B`, and you want to find all their overlaps.\n\n```python\ndef interval_intersection(A, B):\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(A) and j < len(B):\n        startA, endA = A[i]\n        startB, endB = B[j]\n        \n        # Check if intervals overlap\n        if startA <= endB and startB <= endA:\n            # Add the intersection\n            result.append([max(startA, startB), min(endA, endB)])\n        \n        # Move the pointer with the smaller end\n        if endA < endB:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    return result\n```\n\n### Why Two Pointers?\n\n- **Efficiency:** Each interval is processed at most once, yielding O(N + M) time complexity for lists of length N and M.\n- **Avoids Redundant Comparisons:** By always advancing the pointer with the smaller end, you never revisit intervals that cannot possibly overlap.\n\n### Applications\n\n- Finding intersections between two sets of intervals (e.g., calendar availability).\n- Merging overlapping intervals.\n- Counting the number of overlapping intervals at any point.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy sorting intervals and using two pointers to traverse them, you can efficiently find overlaps, intersections, or merge intervals with optimal time complexity. This technique is widely applicable in scheduling, computational geometry, and range query problems.",

    "question": "How can you use two pointers to solve the 'Intersection of Two Linked Lists' problem?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nTo solve the **Intersection of Two Linked Lists** problem using two pointers, you can use the following approach:\n\n### Problem Recap\nGiven the heads of two singly linked lists, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection, return `null`.\n\n### Two Pointers Approach\n\n1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**\n   - Let `pA` start at the head of List A.\n   - Let `pB` start at the head of List B.\n\n2. **Traverse Both Lists:**\n   - Move both pointers forward one node at a time.\n   - When a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list.\n\n3. **Intersection Logic:**\n   - If the lists intersect, the pointers will meet at the intersection node after at most `lengthA + lengthB` steps.\n   - If they do not intersect, both pointers will eventually become `null` at the same time.\n\n### Why This Works\nBy switching heads after reaching the end, both pointers traverse the same total length: `lengthA + lengthB`. This synchronizes their movement so that if there's an intersection, they will meet there.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef getIntersectionNode(headA, headB):\n    if not headA or not headB:\n        return None\n\n    pA, pB = headA, headB\n\n    while pA != pB:\n        pA = pA.next if pA else headB\n        pB = pB.next if pB else headA\n\n    return pA  # Can be the intersection node or None\n```\n\n### Time and Space Complexity\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since only two pointers are used.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe two pointers technique efficiently finds the intersection node by synchronizing the traversal of both lists, ensuring both pointers cover equal distances and meet at the intersection if it exists.\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level explanation in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## Using Two Pointers to Solve \"Remove Nth Node From End of List\"\n\nThe **two pointers** technique is highly effective for this problem, allowing you to remove the Nth node from the end of a singly linked list in one pass.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**  \n   Create two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both starting at a dummy node before the head. The dummy node helps handle edge cases (like removing the head).\n\n2. **Advance Fast Pointer:**  \n   Move the `fast` pointer `n + 1` steps ahead. This creates a gap of `n` nodes between `slow` and `fast`.\n\n3. **Move Both Pointers:**  \n   Move both pointers forward together until `fast` reaches the end (`null`). At this point, `slow` will be just before the node to remove.\n\n4. **Remove the Node:**  \n   Change `slow.next` to `slow.next.next`, effectively removing the Nth node from the end.\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:\n    dummy = ListNode(0, head)\n    fast = slow = dummy\n\n    # Move fast ahead by n+1 steps\n    for _ in range(n + 1):\n        fast = fast.next\n\n    # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end\n    while fast:\n        fast = fast.next\n        slow = slow.next\n\n    # Remove the nth node from end\n    slow.next = slow.next.next\n\n    return dummy.next\n```\n\n### Why Two Pointers?\n\n- **Single Pass:** Only one traversal is needed.\n- **Handles Edge Cases:** The dummy node ensures even the head can be removed cleanly.\n- **Constant Space:** No extra data structures are required.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy maintaining a fixed gap between two pointers, you can efficiently locate and remove the Nth node from the end of a linked list in a single pass.",

Here’s how you can use it:\n\n#### 1. Initialize Two Pointers\n\n- **Left Pointer (`lastNonZeroFoundAt`)**: Tracks the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.\n- **Right Pointer (`current`)**: Iterates through the array.\n\n#### 2. Traverse the Array\n\n- For each element at index `current`:\n  - If it is **non-zero**, swap it with the element at index `lastNonZeroFoundAt`.\n  - Increment `lastNonZeroFoundAt`.\n\n#### 3. Result\n\n- All non-zero elements are moved to the front in their original order.\n- All zeroes are shifted to the end.\n\n#### 4. In-Place and O(n) Time\n\n- This approach modifies the array in-place.\n- It only requires a single pass (O(n) time complexity).\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef moveZeroes(nums):\n    lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0\n    for current in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[current] != 0:\n            nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt], nums[current] = nums[current], nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt]\n            lastNonZeroFoundAt += 1\n```\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nGiven: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`\n\n| Step | current | lastNonZeroFoundAt | Array State      |\n|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 0    | 0       | 0                 | [0, 1, 0, 3, 12] |\n| 1    | 1       | 0                 | [1, 0, 0, 3, 12] |\n| 2    | 2       | 1                 | [1, 0, 0, 3, 12] |\n| 3    | 3       | 1                 | [1, 3, 0, 0, 12] |\n| 4    | 4       | 2                 | [1, 3, 12, 0, 0] |\n\nFinal result: `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe two pointers technique efficiently moves all zeroes to the end in a single pass, preserving the order of non-zero elements and using constant extra space.",

    "answer": "```markdown\nTo solve the **Longest Repeating Character Replacement** problem using the two pointers technique, you can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window `[left, right]` that contains at most `k` characters that need to be replaced to make all characters in the window the same.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Two pointers: `left = 0`, `right = 0`.\n   - A frequency map (e.g., an array of size 26 for uppercase letters).\n   - A variable `max_count` to keep track of the count of the most frequent character in the current window.\n   - A variable `max_length` to store the result.\n\n2. **Expand the window**:\n   - For each character at `right`, increment its count in the frequency map.\n   - Update `max_count` with the maximum frequency in the current window.\n\n3. **Shrink the window if needed**:\n   - If the window size minus `max_count` is greater than `k`, it means we need to replace more than `k` characters, so move `left` pointer to the right and decrement the count of the character at `left`.\n\n4. **Update the result**:\n   - At each step, update `max_length` with the maximum window size found.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef characterReplacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:\n    count = [0] * 26\n    left = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    max_length = 0\n\n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        idx = ord(s[right]) - ord('A')\n        count[idx] += 1\n        max_count = max(max_count, count[idx])\n\n        # If more than k characters need to be replaced, shrink the window\n        while (right - left + 1) - max_count > k:\n            count[ord(s[left]) - ord('A')] -= 1\n            left += 1\n\n        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n\n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The window `[left, right]` always contains at most `k` characters that are not the most frequent character in the window.\n- By maintaining `max_count`, we know how many characters are already the same, so the rest can be replaced.\n- The two pointers (`left` and `right`) efficiently keep track of the current valid window.\n\nThis approach ensures an optimal O(n) time complexity.\n```\n",
