Here’s a comparison:\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- **Linear Search:**  \n  - Checks each element one by one.\n  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)\n- **Binary Search:**  \n  - Repeatedly divides the sorted dataset in half.\n  - **Time Complexity:** O(log n)\n\n### Performance on Large Datasets\n\n- **Linear Search:**  \n  - As the dataset grows, the number of comparisons increases linearly.\n  - For a dataset with 1,000,000 elements, it may require up to 1,000,000 comparisons in the worst case.\n- **Binary Search:**  \n  - The number of comparisons increases logarithmically.\n  - For a dataset with 1,000,000 elements, it only needs about 20 comparisons (since log₂1,000,000 ≈ 20).\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **Binary search** requires the dataset to be **sorted**.\n- **Linear search** works on both sorted and unsorted datasets.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Search Type     | Time Complexity | Sorted Data Required | Comparisons for 1,000,000 Elements |\n|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Linear Search   | O(n)           | No                  | up to 1,000,000                     |\n| Binary Search   | O(log n)       | Yes                 | about 20                             |\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Binary search** is much faster and more scalable than linear search for very large datasets, provided the data is sorted.

    "question": "What is exponential search and how is it related to binary search?",
    "answer": "```markdown **Exponential Search** is an advanced search algorithm designed for searching sorted arrays, especially when the size of the array is large or unbounded (e.g., infinite or unknown length). It combines the strengths of both linear and binary search to efficiently locate an element.\n\n### How Exponential Search Works\n\n1. **Exponential Range Finding**:  \n   Start at the first element. Check the element at index 1, then at index 2, then 4, 8, 16, and so on (i.e., indices at powers of two: 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ...), doubling the index each time, until you find an index where the element is greater than or equal to the target, or you exceed the array bounds.\n\n2. **Binary Search**:  \n   Once the range `[2^{k-1}, 2^k]` is found such that the target lies within this range, perform a standard binary search within this subarray.\n\n### Relationship to Binary Search\n\n- **Exponential search uses binary search as a subroutine.**  \n  The exponential phase quickly narrows down the possible range where the target could be, and then binary search is used to efficiently find the exact index within that range.\n\n- **Efficiency**:  \n  - The exponential phase takes O(log i) time, where i is the index of the target.\n  - The binary search phase also takes O(log i) time within the found range.\n  - **Total time complexity:** O(log i), which is very efficient for large or unbounded arrays.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Searching in unbounded or infinite-sized arrays (e.g., data streams, linked lists with unknown length).\n- Situations where the size of the array is very large and a traditional binary search would require knowing the array length in advance.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\ndef exponential_search(arr, target):\n    if arr[0] == target:\n        return 0\n    index = 1\n    while index < len(arr) and arr[index] <= target:\n        index *= 2\n    # Binary search between index/2 and min(index, len(arr)-1)\n    left, right = index // 2, min(index, len(arr)-1)\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step                | Algorithm Used   | Time Complexity |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Range Finding       | Exponential     | O(log i)        |\n| Target Search       | Binary Search   | O(log i)        |\n| **Total**           |                 | **O(log i)**    |\n\n**In summary:**  \nExponential search is a hybrid algorithm that uses exponential steps to find a search range and then applies binary search within that range. It is particularly useful for searching in large or unbounded sorted arrays, leveraging binary search for efficient lookup after quickly narrowing down the search interval.",

    "question": "How does binary search work on a descending sorted array?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### How Binary Search Works on a Descending Sorted Array\n\nBinary search is a fast algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. When the array is **sorted in descending order** (from largest to smallest), the logic of binary search must be slightly adjusted compared to the standard (ascending order) case.\n\n#### Steps for Binary Search on a Descending Array\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers:**\n   - Set `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.\n\n2. **Iterate:**\n   - While `low <= high`:\n     - Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`.\n     - Compare the target value (`x`) with `arr[mid]`:\n       - **If `arr[mid] == x`:** Return `mid` (element found).\n       - **If `arr[mid] < x`:** Search the **left half** by setting `high = mid - 1`.\n       - **If `arr[mid] > x`:** Search the **right half** by setting `low = mid + 1`.\n\n#### Why the Comparison is Reversed\n\n- In a **descending array**, larger values are at lower indices.\n- If the middle value is **less than** the target, the target must be **to the left**.\n- If the middle value is **greater than** the target, the target must be **to the right**.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose `arr = [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` and you want to find `5`:\n\n| low | high | mid | arr[mid] | Compare to 5 | Next step      |\n|-----|------|-----|----------|--------------|---------------|\n| 0   | 4    | 2   | 5        | ==           | Found at 2    |\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef binary_search_desc(arr, x):\n    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = low + (high - low) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == x:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < x:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBinary search on a descending sorted array works similarly to the standard version, but the direction of search after each comparison is reversed. Always compare carefully and adjust the `low` and `high` pointers accordingly.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Potential Pitfalls When Implementing Binary Search Recursively**\n\n1. **Stack Overflow (Excessive Recursion Depth):**\n   - Recursive binary search can cause a stack overflow if the input array is very large, as each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.\n\n2. **Incorrect Base Case:**\n   - Failing to define the correct base case (e.g., `low > high`) can lead to infinite recursion or missing the termination condition.\n\n3. **Integer Overflow in Mid Calculation:**\n   - Calculating the middle index as `mid = (low + high) / 2` can cause integer overflow for large values. The safer way is:\n     ```python\n     mid = low + (high - low) // 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Not Returning the Result Properly:**\n   - Forgetting to return the result of the recursive call can lead to incorrect results or always returning a default value.\n\n5. **Off-by-One Errors:**\n   - Mistakes in updating the `low` and `high` pointers (e.g., using `mid` instead of `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`) can cause infinite loops or skip potential matches.\n\n6. **Handling Duplicates:**\n   - If the array contains duplicates and you need to find the first or last occurrence, additional logic is required; the standard recursive approach may not suffice.\n\n---\n\n**Example of Safe Recursive Binary Search in Python:**\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, low, high, target):\n    if low > high:\n        return -1\n    mid = low + (high - low) // 2\n    if arr[mid] == target:\n        return mid\n    elif arr[mid] < target:\n        return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, target)\n    else:\n        return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, target)\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nWhen implementing recursive binary search, be careful with base cases, mid calculation, stack depth, and pointer updates to avoid common pitfalls.",

    "question": "Can binary search be used on data stored in external memory (like files)? What are the challenges?",
    "answer": "```markdown Yes, binary search can be used on data stored in external memory (such as files on disk), but there are significant challenges and considerations:\n\n### Challenges\n\n1. **Random Access Requirement**  \n   Binary search relies on the ability to access the middle element of the data efficiently. In RAM, this is trivial with arrays, but in external memory (like files), random access can be much slower, especially if the file is very large or stored on a medium with high seek times (e.g., traditional hard drives).\n\n2. **I/O Overhead**  \n   Each access to a random position in a file may require a disk seek, which is orders of magnitude slower than accessing data in RAM. Binary search on a file will thus incur significant I/O overhead, especially for large files.\n\n3. **Data Organization**  \n   The data must be stored in a format that supports efficient random access. For example, fixed-length records allow easy calculation of the byte offset for any record, but variable-length records complicate this process.\n\n4. **Buffering and Caching**  \n   Operating systems and file systems use buffering and caching to speed up file access, but these mechanisms may not always align well with the access patterns of binary search, potentially leading to cache misses and more disk reads.\n\n5. **Concurrency and Consistency**  \n   If the file is being modified concurrently (by other processes or threads), maintaining consistency during a binary search can be challenging.\n\n### Practical Solutions\n\n- **Fixed-Size Records**: Store data in fixed-size records to allow direct computation of the offset for any record.\n- **Indexing**: Use auxiliary index structures (like B-trees) to reduce the number of disk accesses needed for search operations.\n- **Memory Mapping**: Use memory-mapped files to let the operating system handle paging, though this still doesn't eliminate the fundamental I/O bottleneck.\n- **Batch Reads**: Read larger blocks of data into memory at once to minimize the number of disk accesses.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Challenge                | Description                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Random Access            | Slow and costly on disk compared to RAM                                     |\n| I/O Overhead             | Each search step may require a disk seek                                    |\n| Data Organization        | Fixed-size records are preferable for easy offset calculation               |\n| Buffering/Caching        | May not align with binary search access patterns                            |\n| Concurrency/Consistency  | File changes during search can cause inconsistencies                        |\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nBinary search is possible on external memory, but its efficiency is limited by the high cost of random access and I/O operations.

The problem can be reframed:\n\n- **Search Space:** The minimum distance can range from `1` to the distance between the farthest houses.\n- **Decision Function:** For a given distance `d`, can we place all `k` routers such that each is at least `d` apart?\n- **Binary Search:** Find the largest `d` for which the answer is `true`.\n\n#### **Pseudocode**\n\n```python\ndef is_possible(distance):\n    # Implement logic to check if routers can be placed with at least 'distance' apart\n    pass\n\nleft, right = 1, max_possible_distance\nanswer = 0\n\nwhile left <= right:\n    mid = (left + right) // 2\n    if is_possible(mid):\n        answer = mid\n        left = mid + 1  # Try for a larger distance\n    else:\n        right = mid - 1  # Try for a smaller distance\n\nreturn answer\n```\n\n#### **Other Applications**\n\n- **Minimizing the maximum workload (job scheduling)**\n- **Finding the smallest/largest feasible value in resource allocation**\n- **Optimal cutting of materials (e.g., wood, cable)**\n- **Threshold problems (e.g., minimum speed to arrive on time)**\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Problem Type                | Binary Search On      | Decision Function Checks             |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Maximize minimum distance   | Distance             | Feasibility of placement             |\n| Minimize maximum workload   | Workload             | If jobs can be assigned within limit |\n| Minimize largest piece size | Piece size           | If cuts can be made within limit     |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nBinary search can efficiently solve optimization problems by searching over the answer space, provided the feasibility condition is monotonic. This approach is often called \"binary search on the answer.\"",

    "answer": "```markdown ### Using Binary Search to Find the Minimum or Maximum Value Satisfying a Condition\n\nBinary search is not limited to searching for a specific value in a sorted array; it can also be used to find the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a given condition, especially when the search space is monotonic (i.e., the condition changes from false to true, or vice versa, as you move through the space).\n\n#### General Approach\n\nSuppose you have a function `f(x)` that returns `true` if `x` satisfies the condition, and `false` otherwise. The goal is to find the smallest (or largest) `x` such that `f(x)` is `true`.\n\n##### 1. **Finding the Minimum Value (`x_min`)**\n\n- **Assumption:** For all `x < x_min`, `f(x)` is `false`, and for all `x >= x_min`, `f(x)` is `true`.\n- **Algorithm:**\n    ```python\n    left, right = lower_bound, upper_bound\n    answer = -1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if f(mid):\n            answer = mid\n            right = mid - 1  # Try to find a smaller value\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    # answer is the minimal x such that f(x) is true\n    ```\n\n##### 2. **Finding the Maximum Value (`x_max`)**\n\n- **Assumption:** For all `x <= x_max`, `f(x)` is `true`, and for all `x > x_max`, `f(x)` is `false`.\n- **Algorithm:**\n    ```python\n    left, right = lower_bound, upper_bound\n    answer = -1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if f(mid):\n            answer = mid\n            left = mid + 1  # Try to find a larger value\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    # answer is the maximal x such that f(x) is true\n    ```\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you want to find the smallest integer `x` such that `x^2 >= 30`.\n\n- `f(x) = (x * x >= 30)`\n- Search space: `left = 0`, `right = 30`\n- Using the minimum value binary search, you'll find `x = 6` (since `6^2 = 36 >= 30` and `5^2 = 25 < 30`).\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- The search space must be monotonic with respect to the condition.\n- The function `f(x)` should be efficiently computable.\n- This technique is widely used in optimization problems, such as finding the minimum feasible value or the maximum possible value under constraints.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nBinary search can efficiently find the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a condition by leveraging the monotonicity of the search space and repeatedly narrowing the interval based on the condition's outcome.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nWhen performing binary search on an empty array, the search will immediately determine that the target value is not present. This is because the search range is invalid from the start—there are no elements to examine.\n\nIn most implementations, the algorithm checks if the left index is greater than the right index (e.g., left > right). For an empty array, left is usually 0 and right is -1, so the condition is true right away. Therefore, binary search returns a \"not found\" result (often -1 or False), indicating the target does not exist in the array.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBinary search on an empty array always returns \"not found\" because there are no elements to search.",

    "question": "How do you implement binary search on a 2D matrix?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### Implementing Binary Search on a 2D Matrix\n\nTo perform binary search on a 2D matrix, the matrix must have certain properties. The most common scenario is:\n\n- Each row is sorted in ascending order.\n- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.\n\nThis allows us to treat the 2D matrix as a flattened 1D sorted array.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n1. **Flatten the Matrix Conceptually:**  \n   For a matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns, the element at position `(i, j)` maps to index `i * n + j` in a virtual 1D array.\n\n2. **Apply Binary Search:**  \n   Use standard binary search with `left = 0` and `right = m * n - 1`.  \n   For each `mid`, convert it back to 2D indices:  \n   - `row = mid // n`\n   - `col = mid % n`\n\n3. **Compare and Adjust:**  \n   Compare the matrix element at `(row, col)` with the target and adjust the search range accordingly.\n\n#### Example Code (Python):\n\n```python\ndef searchMatrix(matrix, target):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return False\n    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    left, right = 0, m * n - 1\n\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        row, col = divmod(mid, n)\n        mid_value = matrix[row][col]\n        if mid_value == target:\n            return True\n        elif mid_value < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return False\n```\n\n#### Time Complexity\n\n- **O(log(m * n))**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- If the matrix does **not** have the above properties (e.g., only each row is sorted), a different approach is needed (such as starting from the top-right or bottom-left corner).\n- Always check matrix boundaries to avoid index errors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy treating the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array, you can efficiently apply binary search to find a target value in logarithmic time.",

    "question": "Can binary search be parallelized? If so, how?",
    "answer": "```markdown Yes, binary search can be parallelized, but its potential for parallelization is limited due to its inherently sequential nature. However, there are scenarios and techniques where parallelism can be applied:\n\n### 1. Parallel Binary Search on Multiple Queries\n\nIf you have multiple search queries to perform on the same sorted array, you can execute each binary search independently and in parallel. This is known as **embarrassingly parallel** work, as each search does not depend on the others.\n\n```python\n# Pseudocode for parallel binary search on multiple queries\nparallel_for each query in queries:\n    result[query] = binary_search(array, query)\n```\n\n### 2. Parallelization Within a Single Binary Search\n\nThe classic binary search algorithm is sequential, as each iteration depends on the result of the previous comparison. However, some parallelization is possible in special cases:\n\n- **Parallel Comparison:** In each iteration, you could compare the target value with multiple elements (e.g., the middle, quarter, and three-quarter points) to reduce the search space more aggressively. This is sometimes called **k-ary search** or **fractional cascading**. However, the overhead of extra comparisons and synchronization often outweighs the benefits for typical binary search use cases.\n\n- **Parallel Search in Distributed Systems:** If the data is distributed across multiple machines (e.g., in a distributed database), you can perform binary search in parallel on different partitions, then combine the results.\n\n### 3. Parallel Binary Search for Range Queries\n\nIn some advanced algorithms (e.g., in competitive programming), **parallel binary search** refers to a technique where you process multiple range queries in parallel by dividing the search space and resolving queries concurrently.\n\n### 4. GPU and SIMD Implementations\n\nOn GPUs or with SIMD instructions, you can perform binary search on multiple data elements in parallel, which is useful for batch processing or searching in multiple arrays simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Scenario                                      | Parallelization Feasibility | Notes                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Multiple independent searches                  | High                        | Each search is independent                             |\n| Single search in one array                     | Low                         | Each step depends on previous; limited parallelism     |\n| k-ary search (multi-way branching)             | Moderate                    | More comparisons per step, but diminishing returns     |\n| Distributed/partitioned data                   | Moderate                    | Parallel search on partitions, then merge results      |\n| Batch search on GPU/SIMD                       | High                        | Many searches in parallel for high throughput          |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Parallel Binary Search (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parallel-binary-search/)\n- [k-ary Search (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_search)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nBinary search can be parallelized effectively when handling multiple independent searches or in distributed/batch processing scenarios.

    "answer": "```markdown Debugging common errors in binary search implementation involves systematically checking for typical pitfalls and using effective debugging techniques. Here’s how you can approach it:\n\n## 1. Check Loop Conditions\n\n- **Off-by-one errors**: Ensure your loop condition is correct. For example, use `while (left <= right)` instead of `while (left < right)` if you want to include both endpoints.\n- **Infinite loops**: Make sure the pointers (`left`, `right`, or `mid`) are updated correctly to avoid infinite loops.\n\n## 2. Calculate Midpoint Carefully\n\n- **Integer overflow**: Instead of `(left + right) / 2`, use `left + (right - left) / 2` to prevent overflow in languages with fixed integer sizes.\n- **Correct update**: After checking `mid`, update `left` or `right` correctly:\n  - If searching for a value:  \n    - If `arr[mid] < target`, set `left = mid + 1`\n    - If `arr[mid] > target`, set `right = mid - 1`\n\n## 3. Test Edge Cases\n\n- **Empty array**: What happens if the input array is empty?\n- **Single-element array**: Does your code handle arrays with only one element?\n- **Target not present**: Does your code return the correct result if the target is not in the array?\n- **Duplicates**: If the array contains duplicates, does your code find the correct occurrence (first/last)?\n\n## 4. Use Print Statements or Debugger\n\n- Print the values of `left`, `right`, and `mid` at each iteration to trace the algorithm’s progress.\n- Use a debugger to step through the code and inspect variable values.\n\n## 5. Compare with a Linear Search\n\n- For small arrays, compare the result of your binary search with a simple linear search to verify correctness.\n\n## 6. Review Return Values\n\n- Ensure your function returns the correct index or indicator when the target is found or not found.\n\n---\n\n**Example Debugging Print Statement (Python):**\n```python\nwhile left <= right:\n    mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n    print(f\"left: {left}, right: {right}, mid: {mid}, arr[mid]: {arr[mid]}\")\n    # ... rest of the code\n```\n\n---\n\nBy systematically checking these aspects, you can efficiently debug and fix common errors in binary search implementations.",

    "answer": "```markdown When using binary search on an array with duplicate elements, the algorithm will find one occurrence of the target value, but not necessarily the first or last occurrence. This is because binary search stops as soon as it finds any index where arr[mid] == target.\n\nIf you need to find the first or last occurrence of a duplicate element, you can modify the binary search:\n\n- **First occurrence:** After finding arr[mid] == target, continue searching the left half (set high = mid - 1) to check if the target appears earlier.\n- **Last occurrence:** After finding arr[mid] == target, continue searching the right half (set low = mid + 1) to check if the target appears later.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# Find first occurrence of target in a sorted array with duplicates\ndef binary_search_first(arr, target):\n    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    result = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            result = mid\n            high = mid - 1  # Search left half\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return result\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nStandard binary search returns any one occurrence of the target among duplicates. To find the first or last occurrence, modify the search to continue looking after a match is found.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Impact of Cache Locality on Binary Search Performance**\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array, with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\). However, its real-world performance is also influenced by how well it utilizes the CPU cache, known as **cache locality**.\n\n### 1. **Cache Locality Explained**\n- **Spatial locality**: Accessing memory locations that are close together.\n- **Temporal locality**: Accessing the same memory location repeatedly within a short period.\n\n### 2. **Binary Search and Cache Locality**\n- Binary search repeatedly divides the array and jumps to the middle of the current subarray.\n- These jumps are often non-sequential and can be far apart in memory, especially in large arrays.\n\n### 3. **Performance Implications**\n- **Poor spatial locality**: Since binary search does not access consecutive elements, it often fails to take advantage of spatial locality. Each access may load a new cache line, causing frequent cache misses.\n- **Cache misses**: When the required element is not in the cache, the CPU must fetch it from main memory, which is much slower.\n- **Small arrays**: If the array fits entirely within the CPU cache, binary search is very fast.\n- **Large arrays**: As the array size grows beyond the cache size, the number of cache misses increases, and the performance benefit of \\(O(\\log n)\\) time complexity is reduced.\n\n### 4. **Optimizations**\n- **Cache-aware algorithms**: Techniques like **Eytzinger layout** or **B-tree structures** can improve cache locality by organizing data to maximize cache line utilization.\n- **Block search**: Dividing the array into blocks that fit into cache lines can help improve performance.\n\n### 5. **Summary Table**\n\n| Array Size         | Cache Locality | Binary Search Performance |\n|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| Fits in cache      | Good          | Very fast                |\n| Exceeds cache size | Poor          | Slower due to cache misses|\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile binary search is theoretically efficient, its performance can degrade on large arrays due to poor cache locality. Optimizing data layout and access patterns can help mitigate this effect and improve real-world performance.",

    "question": "How can binary search be used to solve problems on infinite or unbounded arrays?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### Using Binary Search on Infinite or Unbounded Arrays\n\nIn a standard binary search, we require the array's bounds (start and end indices). However, for **infinite or unbounded arrays** (where the size is unknown or conceptually infinite), we need to adapt our approach.\n\n#### Key Idea\n\nSince we can't access the end of the array, we first need to find a range `[low, high]` such that the target element (or the position where it would be) lies within this range. Once this range is identified, we can perform a standard binary search within it.\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. **Find the Search Boundaries:**\n   - Start with a small range, e.g., `low = 0`, `high = 1`.\n   - While `arr[high] < target`:\n     - Move `low` to `high`.\n     - Double `high` (i.e., `high = high * 2`).\n   - This exponentially increases the search window until the target is less than or equal to `arr[high]`.\n\n2. **Apply Binary Search:**\n   - Now, perform a standard binary search between `low` and `high`.\n\n#### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef binary_search_infinite(arr, target):\n    low, high = 0, 1\n    # Find the proper bounds\n    while arr[high] < target:\n        low = high\n        high = high * 2\n\n    # Standard binary search\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = low + (high - low) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n- For truly infinite arrays, you would need a special data structure or API to access elements at any index.\n- In practice, this approach is used for **unbounded sorted arrays** or **streams** where the size is not known in advance.\n- The doubling step ensures that the number of accesses to find the boundary is `O(log p)`, where `p` is the position of the target, making the overall time complexity `O(log p)`.\n\n#### Applications\n\n- Searching in large files or data streams.\n- Searching in linked lists or other data structures where size is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBinary search can be adapted to infinite or unbounded arrays by first finding a suitable search range using exponential expansion, then applying standard binary search within that range. This allows efficient searching even when array bounds are not known.",

    "question": "How do you handle floating point numbers in binary search?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### Handling Floating Point Numbers in Binary Search\n\nWhen performing binary search on floating point numbers (e.g., searching for a value in a sorted array of doubles or finding a root of a function), you need to account for the imprecision of floating point arithmetic. Here’s how you can handle it:\n\n#### 1. Use an Epsilon (Tolerance)\n\nInstead of checking for exact equality (`mid == target`), check if the difference is within a small threshold (epsilon):\n\n```python\nepsilon = 1e-6  # or some small value appropriate for your problem\n\nwhile right - left > epsilon:\n    mid = (left + right) / 2\n    if abs(mid - target) < epsilon:\n        return mid\n    elif mid < target:\n        left = mid\n    else:\n        right = mid\n```\n\n#### 2. Stopping Condition\n\n- For arrays: Stop when the difference between `left` and `right` is less than `epsilon`.\n- For functions (e.g., root finding): Stop when `abs(f(mid)) < epsilon`.\n\n#### 3. Avoid Infinite Loops\n\nDue to floating point rounding, always use the epsilon-based stopping condition instead of relying on `left <= right`.\n\n#### 4. Example: Finding Square Root\n\n```python\ndef sqrt_binary_search(x):\n    left, right = 0, x\n    epsilon = 1e-6\n    while right - left > epsilon:\n        mid = (left + right) / 2\n        if mid * mid < x:\n            left = mid\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return (left + right) / 2\n```\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Step                | Integer Binary Search         | Floating Point Binary Search           |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Comparison          | `mid == target`              | `abs(mid - target) < epsilon`          |\n| Loop condition      | `left <= right`              | `right - left > epsilon`               |\n| Update pointers     | `left = mid + 1`/`right = mid - 1` | `left = mid`/`right = mid`      |\n\n---\n\n**Key Point:**  \nAlways use a small epsilon to compare floating point numbers and as a stopping condition to ensure accuracy and avoid infinite loops.",

    "question": "How do you use binary search to solve the 'search in a rotated sorted array' problem?",
    "answer": "```markdown To solve the \"search in a rotated sorted array\" problem using binary search, you need to adapt the standard binary search to account for the rotation. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n## Problem Recap\n\nGiven a rotated sorted array (e.g., `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`) and a target value, return the index of the target if it exists, otherwise return -1.\n\n---\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set `left = 0` and `right = n - 1` (where `n` is the array length).\n2. **Modified Binary Search**:\n    - While `left <= right`:\n        1. Compute `mid = (left + right) // 2`.\n        2. If `nums[mid] == target`, return `mid`.\n        3. Determine which half is sorted:\n            - **Left half is sorted** if `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`:\n                - If `nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]`, search the left half: `right = mid - 1`.\n                - Else, search the right half: `left = mid + 1`.\n            - **Right half is sorted** if `nums[mid] < nums[right]`:\n                - If `nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]`, search the right half: `left = mid + 1`.\n                - Else, search the left half: `right = mid - 1`.\n3. If the loop ends, return -1 (target not found).\n\n---\n\n## Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\ndef search(nums, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        # Left half is sorted\n        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:\n            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        # Right half is sorted\n        else:\n            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Insight\n\nAt each step, at least one half of the array is sorted. By checking which half is sorted and whether the target lies within that half, you can discard half of the search space, maintaining O(log n) time complexity.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [LeetCode 33.

    "question": "How can binary search be used in competitive programming?",
    "answer": "```markdown Binary search is a powerful technique widely used in competitive programming to efficiently solve problems involving sorted data or monotonic functions. Here’s how binary search can be applied:\n\n## 1. **Finding Elements in Sorted Arrays**\nBinary search quickly locates an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time, which is much faster than linear search.\n\n```cpp\nint binarySearch(vector<int>& arr, int target) {\n    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;\n    while(left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if(arr[mid] == target) return mid;\n        else if(arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;\n        else right = mid - 1;\n    }\n    return -1; // Not found\n}\n```\n\n## 2. **Finding Boundaries (Lower/Upper Bound)**\nBinary search helps find the first or last occurrence of a value, or the smallest/largest value satisfying a condition.\n\n- **Lower Bound:** First position where `arr[i] >= target`\n- **Upper Bound:** First position where `arr[i] > target`\n\n## 3. **Answering Range Queries**\nWhen asked to find the number of elements less than or greater than a value in a sorted array, binary search can efficiently compute the answer.\n\n## 4. **Binary Search on the Answer**\nFor problems where the answer lies within a range and you can check if a candidate answer is valid (monotonic property), binary search can be used to find the optimal answer.\n\n**Example:** Finding the minimum largest sum when splitting an array into `k` subarrays.\n\n```cpp\nbool isPossible(vector<int>& nums, int maxSum, int k) {\n    int count = 1, currSum = 0;\n    for(int num : nums) {\n        if(currSum + num > maxSum) {\n            count++;\n            currSum = 0;\n        }\n        currSum += num;\n    }\n    return count <= k;\n}\n\nint splitArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {\n    int left = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());\n    int right = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);\n    while(left < right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if(isPossible(nums, mid, k)) right = mid;\n        else left = mid + 1;\n    }\n    return left;\n}\n```\n\n## 5. **Applications Beyond Arrays**\nBinary search can be used on:\n\n- **Monotonic functions:** To find roots or thresholds.\n- **Search space:** To minimize or maximize a value under constraints.\n- **Custom data structures:** Like searching in trees or implicit arrays.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn competitive programming, binary search is a versatile tool for solving search and optimization problems efficiently, especially when the problem exhibits a monotonic property or involves sorted data. Mastering binary search and its variants is essential for success in contests.",
