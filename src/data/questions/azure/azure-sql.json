    "answer": "```markdown ### How Automatic Failover Works in Azure SQL Database\n\nAzure SQL Database provides **automatic failover** as part of its built-in high availability and disaster recovery features. Here’s how it works:\n\n#### 1. **High Availability Architecture**\n- Azure SQL Database uses a **replicated architecture** (such as Always On availability groups) to maintain multiple copies of your database.\n- These replicas are distributed across different physical nodes within the same region (zone-redundant) or across regions (geo-redundant).\n\n#### 2. **Health Monitoring**\n- The system continuously monitors the health of the primary database replica.\n- If a failure is detected (hardware, software, or network issue), the service automatically triggers a failover.\n\n#### 3. **Failover Process**\n- One of the secondary replicas is promoted to become the new primary.\n- The DNS entries are updated so that applications can reconnect to the new primary with minimal downtime.\n- The failover process is **automatic and transparent** to users—no manual intervention is required.\n\n#### 4. **Connection Handling**\n- Applications using **retry logic** can seamlessly reconnect after failover.\n- Connection strings with the `MultiSubnetFailover=True` parameter (for SQL Managed Instance) or using the recommended connection strings for Azure SQL Database help minimize downtime.\n\n#### 5. **Geo-Replication (Optional)**\n- For disaster recovery, you can configure **Active Geo-Replication**.\n- In the event of a regional outage, you can manually or programmatically fail over to a geo-replicated secondary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Feature                | Description                                               |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Automatic Detection    | Monitors health and triggers failover automatically       |\n| Replica Promotion      | Secondary replica becomes new primary                     |\n| Minimal Downtime       | Typically seconds to a minute                             |\n| Transparent to Users   | No manual intervention needed                             |\n| Geo-Replication        | Optional for cross-region disaster recovery               |\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [High availability and disaster recovery - Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/high-availability-sla)\n- [Active Geo-Replication - Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/active-geo-replication-overview)\n\n**Tip:** Always use recommended connection resiliency patterns to ensure your applications handle failovers smoothly.",

    "answer": "```markdown To implement row-level security (RLS) in Azure SQL, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Create a Security Predicate Function\n\nThis is an inline table-valued function that determines whether a user can access a particular row.\n\n```sql\nCREATE SCHEMA Security;\nGO\n\nCREATE FUNCTION Security.fn_securitypredicate(@UserID int)\nRETURNS TABLE\nWITH SCHEMABINDING\nAS\nRETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result\nWHERE @UserID = CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'UserID') AS int);\nGO\n```\n\n### 2. Create a Security Policy\n\nApply the predicate function to your table using a security policy.\n\n```sql\nCREATE SECURITY POLICY Security.UserFilter\nADD FILTER PREDICATE Security.fn_securitypredicate(UserID)\nON dbo.YourTable\nWITH (STATE = ON);\nGO\n```\n\n### 3. Set the SESSION_CONTEXT for Each User\n\nBefore querying, set the `SESSION_CONTEXT` to the current user's ID (typically done in your application code):\n\n```sql\nEXEC sp_set_session_context @key = N'UserID', @value = 42; -- Replace 42 with the actual user ID\n```\n\n### 4. Test Row-Level Security\n\nNow, when users query `dbo.YourTable`, they will only see rows where `UserID` matches the value set in `SESSION_CONTEXT`.\n\n### Notes\n\n- You can create more complex predicates for different scenarios (e.g., multiple columns, roles).\n- RLS is transparent to applications; no code changes are needed except for setting the session context.\n- Always test your RLS implementation to ensure it works as intended.\n\n**References:**  \n- [Microsoft Docs: Row-Level Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/row-level-security)",

    "question": "What is Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in Azure SQL?",
    "answer": "```markdown **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in Azure SQL**\n\nTransparent Data Encryption (TDE) is a security feature in Azure SQL that automatically encrypts the storage of an entire database, including its backups and transaction log files, at rest. This means that the data is encrypted on disk without requiring any changes to the application.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Protects sensitive data by encrypting the underlying files of the database, helping to prevent unauthorized access to data at rest.\n- **How it works:** TDE uses a symmetric key called the Database Encryption Key (DEK), which is stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery. The DEK is itself protected by a built-in server certificate managed by Azure.\n- **Automatic management:** In Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, TDE is enabled by default for all new databases, and key management is handled by Azure.\n- **No application changes:** Since encryption and decryption are handled transparently, applications can interact with the database as usual, with no need to modify queries or connection strings.\n- **Compliance:** TDE helps organizations meet compliance requirements for data protection and privacy.\n\n**References:**\n- [Transparent Data Encryption with Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql)\n- [Azure SQL Database security overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview)\n\n**Example:**\n```sql\n-- Check if TDE is enabled on a database\nSELECT name, is_encrypted\nFROM sys.databases;\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nTDE in Azure SQL ensures that your data is securely encrypted at rest, with minimal administrative overhead and no impact on application functionality.",

    "question": "What are managed identities and how are they used with Azure SQL?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### What are Managed Identities?\n\nManaged identities are a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that provide automatically managed identities for Azure resources. These identities can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without needing to manage credentials in your code.\n\nThere are two types of managed identities:\n- **System-assigned:** Enabled directly on an Azure resource (like an Azure VM or Azure App Service). The lifecycle of this identity is tied to the resource.\n- **User-assigned:** Created as a standalone Azure resource and can be assigned to one or more resources.\n\n---\n\n### How are Managed Identities Used with Azure SQL?\n\nManaged identities simplify secure access to Azure SQL Database by allowing applications to authenticate using Azure AD, rather than storing and managing SQL credentials.\n\n#### Typical Usage Steps:\n\n1. **Enable Managed Identity:**  \n   Enable a managed identity (system-assigned or user-assigned) on your Azure resource (e.g., Azure Function, Web App, VM).\n\n2. **Grant Azure SQL Permissions:**  \n   In Azure SQL Database, create an Azure AD user that corresponds to the managed identity and grant it the necessary database roles/permissions.\n   ```sql\n   CREATE USER [<managed-identity-name>] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;\n   ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [<managed-identity-name>];\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure Application Authentication:**  \n   In your application, use Azure AD authentication libraries (like `DefaultAzureCredential` in Azure SDKs) to acquire a token for Azure SQL Database.\n\n4. **Connect to Azure SQL:**  \n   Use the acquired token to connect to Azure SQL Database, instead of using a username and password.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **No credentials in code:** Reduces risk of credential leakage.\n- **Automatic credential management:** Azure handles identity lifecycle and rotation.\n- **Improved security:** Leverages Azure AD for authentication and access control.\n\n---\n\n**Example Connection (C#):**\n```csharp\nvar connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString)\n{\n    AccessToken = (new DefaultAzureCredential()).GetToken(\n        new TokenRequestContext(new[] { \"https://database.windows.net/.default\" })\n    ).Token\n};\nawait connection.OpenAsync();\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nManaged identities provide a secure and convenient way for Azure resources to authenticate to Azure SQL Database using Azure AD, eliminating the need for hard-coded credentials and simplifying identity management.",

    "answer": "```markdown\n## Automating Backups and Restores in Azure SQL\n\n### Automated Backups\n\nAzure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance provide **automated backups** by default. Here’s how it works:\n\n- **Automatic Backups:** Azure automatically creates full, differential, and transaction log backups.\n- **Retention Period:** Backups are retained for 7-35 days (configurable), depending on your service tier.\n- **Geo-Redundancy:** Backups can be stored in geo-redundant storage for disaster recovery.\n\n**No manual configuration is required** for basic backup automation. However, you can configure backup retention and geo-redundancy via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.\n\n#### Example: Configure Backup Retention (Azure CLI)\n```bash\naz sql db backup short-term-retention-policy update \\\n  --resource-group myResourceGroup \\\n  --server myServer \\\n  --database myDatabase \\\n  --retention-days 14\n```\n\n### Automated Restores\n\nYou can automate restores using **Point-in-Time Restore** or **Automated Database Copy**:\n\n#### 1. **Point-in-Time Restore**\nRestores a database to a specific point within the retention period.\n\n- **Azure Portal:** Go to your database > \"Restore\" > select point in time.\n- **Azure CLI Example:**\n  ```bash\n  az sql db restore \\\n    --dest-name myRestoredDatabase \\\n    --name myDatabase \\\n    --resource-group myResourceGroup \\\n    --server myServer \\\n    --time \"2024-06-01T12:00:00Z\"\n  ```\n\n#### 2. **Automated Database Copy**\nYou can schedule regular database copies using Azure Automation or Logic Apps for more advanced scenarios.\n\n- **PowerShell Example:**\n  ```powershell\n  New-AzSqlDatabaseCopy -ResourceGroupName \"myResourceGroup\" `\n    -ServerName \"myServer\" `\n    -DatabaseName \"myDatabase\" `\n    -CopyDatabaseName \"myDatabaseCopy\"\n  ```\n\n### Advanced Automation\n\nFor more complex backup/restore automation (e.g., scheduled restores to dev/test environments), use:\n\n- **Azure Automation Runbooks**\n- **Azure Logic Apps**\n- **Azure Functions**\n\nThese can orchestrate restore operations, notify stakeholders, or integrate with CI/CD pipelines.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAzure SQL automates backups by default. Restores can be automated using Azure CLI, PowerShell, or orchestration tools like Azure Automation, depending on your requirements.\n```",

    "question": "What are long-term retention backups in Azure SQL?",
    "answer": "```markdown **Long-term retention (LTR) backups** in Azure SQL are a feature that allows you to store full database backups for extended periods—up to 10 years. These backups are separate from the standard point-in-time restore backups and are designed to help organizations meet compliance, regulatory, or business requirements for data retention.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Purpose:** LTR backups are mainly used for archival and compliance, not for day-to-day restores.\n- **How it works:** You configure an LTR policy on your Azure SQL Database or Managed Instance, specifying how often to take full backups (weekly, monthly, yearly) and how long to retain them.\n- **Storage:** LTR backups are stored in Azure Blob Storage, separate from the regular backup chain.\n- **Restoration:** You can restore an LTR backup as a new database at any time during its retention period.\n- **Configuration:** LTR policies can be set using the Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, or ARM templates.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nIf you set a policy to keep a weekly full backup for 5 years, Azure will automatically retain one full backup per week for 5 years, allowing you to restore the database to the state it was in at the time of any of those backups.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Compliance:** Meets legal and regulatory requirements for data retention.\n- **Disaster Recovery:** Provides an additional layer of backup for critical data.\n- **Flexibility:** Easily restore archived backups when needed.\n\n### References\n\n- [Azure SQL Database long-term backup retention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/long-term-retention-overview)\n- [Configure long-term backup retention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/long-term-retention-configure)",

    "question": "How do you implement sharding in Azure SQL Database?",
    "answer": "```markdown To implement sharding in Azure SQL Database, you typically use the **Elastic Database tools** provided by Azure. Sharding is the process of splitting data across multiple databases (shards), each holding a subset of the data, to improve scalability and performance.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step overview of how to implement sharding in Azure SQL Database:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Design the Sharding Strategy**\n\n- **Choose a Shard Key:** Select a column (e.g., CustomerID, TenantID) that will determine how data is distributed across shards.\n- **Determine Shard Map:** Decide how to map shard key values to specific databases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Provision Shard Databases**\n\n- Create multiple Azure SQL Databases, each representing a shard.\n- Each shard has the same schema but contains a subset of the data.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Set Up the Shard Map Manager**\n\nAzure provides the **Elastic Database Client Library** (for .NET) to manage sharding.\n\n- Create a **Shard Map Manager** database (a central metadata repository).\n- Use the library to create and manage shard maps (either Range or List maps).\n\n```csharp\n// Example: Create a Shard Map Manager\nShardMapManager smm = ShardMapManagerFactory.CreateSqlShardMapManager(\n    connectionString, ShardMapManagerCreateMode.KeepExisting);\n\n// Create a List Shard Map\nListShardMap<int> shardMap = smm.CreateListShardMap<int>(\"CustomerShardMap\");\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Register Shards**\n\n- Register each shard (database) with the Shard Map Manager.\n- Map specific key ranges or values to each shard.\n\n```csharp\n// Register a shard\nShard shard = shardMap.CreateShard(new ShardLocation(server, database, SqlProtocol.Tcp, 1433));\nshardMap.AddMapping(new PointMapping<int>(customerId, shard, MappingStatus.Online));\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Implement Data Access Logic**\n\n- Use the Elastic Database Client Library to route queries to the correct shard based on the shard key.\n\n```csharp\n// Open a connection to the correct shard\nusing (SqlConnection conn = shardMap.OpenConnectionForKey(customerId, connectionString, ConnectionOptions.Validate))\n{\n    // Execute queries as usual\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Scaling and Management**\n\n- Add new shards as data grows.\n- Use the library’s APIs to split or merge shards if needed.\n- Monitor and rebalance data as necessary.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Optional: Elastic Database Jobs**\n\n- Use **Elastic Database Jobs** for cross-shard operations (e.g., reporting, schema updates).\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [Azure SQL Database Elastic Database tools documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/elastic-scale-introduction)\n- [Elastic Database Client Library (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.SqlDatabase.ElasticScale.Client)\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step                         | Description                                                      |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Design Sharding Strategy     | Choose shard key and mapping approach                            |\n| Provision Shard Databases    | Create multiple Azure SQL Databases                              |\n| Set Up Shard Map Manager     | Use Elastic Database tools to manage shard metadata              |\n| Register Shards              | Map key ranges/values to each shard                              |\n| Implement Data Access Logic  | Route queries to correct shard using client library              |\n| Scaling and Management       | Add/split/merge shards as needed                                 |\n| Elastic Database Jobs        | For cross-shard operations                                       |\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nWhile the Elastic Database Client Library is primarily for .NET, you can implement similar logic in other languages by managing shard maps and routing in your application code.

You can add masking rules using the Azure Portal, PowerShell, or T-SQL.\n\n2. **Define Masking Rules**\n\n   There are several masking functions:\n   - `Default()`: Full masking according to data type.\n   - `Email()`: Masks email addresses.\n   - `Custom String(prefix, padding, suffix)`: Shows part of the string and masks the rest.\n   - `Random([startRange], [endRange])`: Masks numeric data with a random value in the specified range.\n\n3. **Add a Masking Rule Using T-SQL**\n\n   ```sql\n   ALTER TABLE dbo.Customers\n   ALTER COLUMN EmailAddress ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'email()');\n   ```\n\n   ```sql\n   ALTER TABLE dbo.Customers\n   ALTER COLUMN CreditCardNumber ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(2,\"XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-\",4)');\n   ```\n\n4. **Manage Unmask Privileges**\n\n   By default, database administrators and users with the `UNMASK` permission can see unmasked data.\n\n   To grant unmask privilege:\n   ```sql\n   GRANT UNMASK TO [username];\n   ```\n\n   To revoke:\n   ```sql\n   REVOKE UNMASK TO [username];\n   ```\n\n5. **Querying Masked Data**\n\n   When a user without `UNMASK` permission queries the masked column:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EmailAddress FROM dbo.Customers;\n   ```\n   The result will show masked values (e.g., `xxxx@xxxx.com`).\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you have a table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Employees (\n    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Name NVARCHAR(100),\n    SSN CHAR(11) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()'),\n    Email NVARCHAR(100) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'email()')\n);\n```\n\nA non-privileged user querying `SSN` or `Email` will see masked data.\n\n#### Additional Notes\n\n- DDM does not encrypt data; it only masks query results.\n- Masking rules can be added or removed at any time.\n- Use DDM as part of a broader security strategy (e.g., encryption, access control).\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Dynamic Data Masking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/dynamic-data-masking-overview)\n```\n",

    "question": "What is the role of Query Store in Azure SQL?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n**Query Store in Azure SQL: Advanced Overview**\n\nThe Query Store in Azure SQL is a powerful feature designed to help database administrators and developers monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize query performance over time. Its primary roles include:\n\n1. **Capturing Query History**  \n   Query Store automatically captures a history of executed queries, their execution plans, and runtime statistics. This historical data is persisted, allowing for analysis of performance trends and regressions, even after server restarts or plan cache flushes.\n\n2. **Performance Troubleshooting**  \n   By storing multiple execution plans for each query, Query Store enables identification of plan changes that may have led to performance degradation. This is especially useful for diagnosing issues caused by parameter sniffing or suboptimal plan selection.\n\n3. **Plan Forcing**  \n   Query Store allows administrators to force the use of a specific execution plan for a query. This can quickly resolve performance issues by reverting to a previously efficient plan while a permanent fix is developed.\n\n4. **Regressions Detection**  \n   Query Store provides built-in reports and views to detect query performance regressions, making it easier to pinpoint when and why a query started performing poorly.\n\n5. **Data-Driven Tuning**  \n   The data collected by Query Store supports intelligent tuning features such as Automatic Plan Correction, which can automatically force better-performing plans when regressions are detected.\n\n6. **Integration with Azure Features**  \n   In Azure SQL Database, Query Store integrates with Intelligent Insights and Automatic Tuning, providing proactive recommendations and automated remediation for query performance issues.\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Feature                    | Description                                                      |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Query history retention    | Stores queries, plans, and stats over time                       |\n| Troubleshooting            | Identifies plan changes and performance regressions              |\n| Plan forcing               | Allows enforcing a specific plan for problematic queries         |\n| Regression detection       | Highlights queries with degraded performance                     |\n| Automatic tuning support   | Enables features like Automatic Plan Correction                  |\n| Azure integration          | Works with Intelligent Insights and Automatic Tuning in Azure SQL|\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Query Store in Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/query-store-overview)\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown Azure SQL integrates seamlessly with a wide range of Azure services, enabling developers to build robust, scalable, and automated solutions. Here’s how Azure SQL works with some key Azure services:\n\n## 1. Azure Functions\n\n- **Event-driven Data Processing**: Azure Functions can be triggered by events (such as HTTP requests, queue messages, or scheduled timers) and interact with Azure SQL to read, write, or update data.\n- **Bindings**: Azure Functions provides input and output bindings for Azure SQL, allowing you to declaratively connect your function to your database without writing boilerplate connection code.\n- **Use Cases**: Real-time data processing, ETL pipelines, and microservices that need to interact with Azure SQL.\n\n**Example**:  \nA function triggered by a new message in Azure Queue Storage inserts data into an Azure SQL table.\n\n```csharp\npublic static async Task Run(\n    [QueueTrigger(\"myqueue\")] string queueItem,\n    [Sql(\"dbo.MyTable\", ConnectionStringSetting = \"SqlConnectionString\")] IAsyncCollector<MyData> sqlOutput)\n{\n    var data = new MyData { Value = queueItem };\n    await sqlOutput.AddAsync(data);\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Logic Apps\n\n- **Workflow Automation**: Logic Apps allows you to design workflows that integrate with Azure SQL using built-in connectors.\n- **Triggers and Actions**: You can trigger workflows based on changes in Azure SQL (e.g., when a row is inserted or updated) or perform actions like executing queries or stored procedures.\n- **No-Code Integration**: Logic Apps provides a visual designer, making it easy to automate business processes without writing code.\n\n**Example**:  \nA Logic App monitors an Azure SQL table for new records and sends an email notification via Outlook when a new row is detected.\n\n## 3. Other Integrations\n\n- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestrate data movement and transformation between Azure SQL and other data sources.\n- **Power BI**: Connect directly to Azure SQL for real-time analytics and reporting.\n- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Integrate Azure SQL as a data source for big data analytics and machine learning.\n\n## 4. Security and Identity\n\n- **Managed Identities**: Azure SQL supports Azure AD authentication, allowing services like Functions and Logic Apps to securely connect without storing credentials.\n- **Private Endpoints**: Secure integration via private networking.\n\n## 5. Monitoring and Alerts\n\n- **Azure Monitor**: Collect metrics and logs from Azure SQL and trigger automated actions (e.g., via Logic Apps or Functions) based on performance or security events.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nAzure SQL’s deep integration with Azure services like Functions and Logic Apps enables event-driven architectures, workflow automation, secure data access, and seamless orchestration of cloud solutions—all with minimal custom code and robust security.",

    "question": "How do you monitor and manage index fragmentation in Azure SQL?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### Monitoring and Managing Index Fragmentation in Azure SQL\n\n#### 1. **Monitoring Index Fragmentation**\n\nAzure SQL Database does not provide direct access to the underlying OS, but you can monitor index fragmentation using T-SQL queries against system views:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    dbschemas.[name] AS 'Schema',\n    dbtables.[name] AS 'Table',\n    dbindexes.[name] AS 'Index',\n    indexstats.avg_fragmentation_in_percent,\n    indexstats.page_count\nFROM \n    sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), NULL, NULL, NULL, 'LIMITED') AS indexstats\nINNER JOIN \n    sys.tables dbtables ON dbtables.[object_id] = indexstats.[object_id]\nINNER JOIN \n    sys.schemas dbschemas ON dbtables.[schema_id] = dbschemas.[schema_id]\nINNER JOIN \n    sys.indexes AS dbindexes ON dbindexes.[object_id] = indexstats.[object_id]\n    AND indexstats.index_id = dbindexes.index_id\nWHERE \n    indexstats.database_id = DB_ID()\n    AND indexstats.page_count > 100\nORDER BY \n    indexstats.avg_fragmentation_in_percent DESC;\n```\n\n- `avg_fragmentation_in_percent` indicates the level of fragmentation.\n- `page_count > 100` filters out small indexes.\n\n#### 2. **Managing Index Fragmentation**\n\n- **Reorganize**: Use when fragmentation is between 5% and 30%.\n- **Rebuild**: Use when fragmentation is above 30%.\n\n**Example T-SQL scripts:**\n\n- **Reorganize Index:**\n    ```sql\n    ALTER INDEX [IndexName] ON [Schema].[TableName] REORGANIZE;\n    ```\n\n- **Rebuild Index:**\n    ```sql\n    ALTER INDEX [IndexName] ON [Schema].[TableName] REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON);\n    ```\n\nYou can automate this process using an Azure Elastic Job or an Azure Automation Runbook.\n\n#### 3. **Automating Index Maintenance**\n\n- **Azure Elastic Jobs**: Schedule and automate index maintenance across multiple databases.\n- **Azure Automation**: Use PowerShell or runbooks to execute index maintenance scripts on a schedule.\n\n**Sample Maintenance Script:**\n```sql\nDECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(128)\nDECLARE @IndexName NVARCHAR(128)\nDECLARE @SchemaName NVARCHAR(128)\nDECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX)\n\nDECLARE cur CURSOR FOR\nSELECT \n    s.name, t.name, i.name\nFROM \n    sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), NULL, NULL, NULL, 'LIMITED') ips\n    JOIN sys.indexes i ON ips.object_id = i.object_id AND ips.index_id = i.index_id\n    JOIN sys.tables t ON t.object_id = i.object_id\n    JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id\nWHERE \n    ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent > 30\n    AND ips.page_count > 100\n    AND i.type_desc = 'CLUSTERED' -- or 'NONCLUSTERED'\n\nOPEN cur\nFETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO @SchemaName, @TableName, @IndexName\n\nWHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0\nBEGIN\n    SET @SQL = N'ALTER INDEX [' + @IndexName + '] ON [' + @SchemaName + '].[' + @TableName + '] REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON);'\n    EXEC sp_executesql @SQL\n    FETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO @SchemaName, @TableName, @IndexName\nEND\n\nCLOSE cur\nDEALLOCATE cur\n```\n\n#### 4. **Best Practices**\n\n- Regularly monitor fragmentation, especially for large and frequently updated tables.\n- Automate index maintenance to run during off-peak hours.\n- For **Azure SQL Managed Instance**, you can use SQL Agent jobs for scheduling.\n- For **Azure SQL Database**, use Elastic Jobs or Automation.\n\n#### 5. **References**\n\n- [Microsoft Docs: Monitor and Tune for Index Fragmentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/index-fragmentation)\n- [Automating Index and Statistics Maintenance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/scripts/automate-index-statistics-maintenance)\n\n---\n**Summary:**  \nMonitor index fragmentation using `sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats`, and manage it with `ALTER INDEX ... REORGANIZE` or `REBUILD`. Automate the process using Elastic Jobs or Azure Automation for optimal performance in Azure SQL.\n```\n",
