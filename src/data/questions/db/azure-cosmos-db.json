        "question": "How is data distributed in Azure Cosmos DB?",
        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\nIn Azure Cosmos DB, data is distributed using a concept called **partitioning**. When you create a container (such as a collection or table), you choose a **partition key**. This key is a property in your data that Cosmos DB uses to divide your data into multiple logical partitions.\n\nEach partition contains a subset of your data, and Cosmos DB automatically manages these partitions across multiple physical servers. This allows Cosmos DB to scale out and handle large amounts of data and high request rates efficiently.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Data is distributed based on the value of the partition key.\n- Items with the same partition key value are stored together.\n- Cosmos DB automatically balances and manages partitions as your data grows.\n\n**Example:**\nIf you have a collection of user profiles and choose `userId` as the partition key, all data for the same user will be stored together in the same partition.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Enables horizontal scaling.\n- Improves performance and availability.\n- Simplifies management of large datasets.",

        "answer": "### Scaling Throughput in Azure Cosmos DB\n\nAzure Cosmos DB allows you to scale throughput to meet the needs of your application. Throughput is measured in **Request Units per second (RU/s)**. There are two main ways to scale throughput:\n\n#### 1. **Manually Provisioned Throughput**\n- **At the Container Level:** You can assign a specific RU/s value to an individual container (e.g., a collection or table).\n- **At the Database Level (Shared Throughput):** You can provision throughput at the database level, and all containers within that database share the allocated RU/s.\n\n**How to scale:**\n- Use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or SDKs to increase or decrease the RU/s value as needed.\n- Changes take effect almost instantly.\n\n#### 2. **Autoscale Throughput**\n- Cosmos DB offers **autoscale** (formerly called \"autopilot\") throughput, where you specify a maximum RU/s, and Cosmos DB automatically scales the throughput between 10% and 100% of the maximum based on your workload.\n- This is useful for workloads with unpredictable or variable traffic.\n\n**How to enable:**\n- When creating a new container or database, select the autoscale option and specify the maximum RU/s.\n- You can also convert existing resources to autoscale.\n\n#### 3. **Global Distribution**\n- If your Cosmos DB account is globally distributed, throughput can be scaled independently in each region to ensure low-latency access and high availability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Scaling Method         | Description                                  | Use Case                        |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Manual Provisioning   | Set RU/s manually at container or DB level   | Predictable workloads           |\n| Autoscale             | RU/s automatically scales with demand        | Variable or unpredictable loads |\n| Global Distribution   | Scale throughput per region                  | Multi-region deployments        |\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Azure Cosmos DB Throughput](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/provision-throughput)\n- [Autoscale in Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/provision-throughput-autoscale)",

        "question": "How does Cosmos DB ensure data durability?",
        "answer": "Cosmos DB ensures data durability through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Automatic Replication**  \n   Every piece of data written to Cosmos DB is automatically replicated across multiple physical partitions within a region. By default, Cosmos DB maintains four replicas of your data within each region.\n\n2. **Quorum-based Writes**  \n   When a write operation occurs, Cosmos DB uses a quorum-based protocol. A write is only acknowledged as successful after a majority of replicas confirm the write, ensuring that data is not lost even if some replicas fail.\n\n3. **Multi-region Replication**  \n   For additional durability, Cosmos DB can be configured to replicate data across multiple Azure regions. This protects against regional outages and enables geo-redundancy.\n\n4. **Automatic Failover**  \n   In the event of hardware or regional failures, Cosmos DB automatically fails over to healthy replicas or regions, ensuring continuous data availability and durability.\n\n5. **Write-ahead Logging**  \n   Cosmos DB uses write-ahead logging to persist changes before they are applied, further protecting against data loss in case of unexpected failures.\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Mechanism                | Description                                                      |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Automatic Replication    | Four replicas per region                                         |\n| Quorum-based Writes      | Writes acknowledged after majority confirmation                  |\n| Multi-region Replication | Data copied to multiple Azure regions                            |\n| Automatic Failover       | Seamless transition to healthy replicas/regions on failure       |\n| Write-ahead Logging      | Changes logged before being applied for extra protection         |\n\nThese combined strategies ensure that your data in Azure Cosmos DB is highly durable and resilient to failures.",

        "answer": "**TTL (Time to Live) in Azure Cosmos DB**\n\nTTL (Time to Live) is a feature in Azure Cosmos DB that automatically deletes items (documents) from a container after a specified period of time. This helps manage storage costs and ensures that outdated or irrelevant data is removed without manual intervention.\n\n### How TTL Works\n\n- **Enabling TTL:** TTL can be enabled at the container level. Once enabled, you can specify a default expiration period (in seconds) for all items in the container.\n- **Per-Item TTL:** You can override the container-level TTL by setting a specific TTL value on individual items using the `ttl` property.\n- **Automatic Deletion:** When an item’s TTL expires, Cosmos DB automatically and asynchronously deletes the item from the container.\n- **Disabling TTL:** Setting the TTL value to `-1` disables automatic deletion for the container or item.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- **Session management:** Automatically remove expired user sessions.\n- **Cache scenarios:** Store temporary data that should expire after a certain period.\n- **Compliance:** Ensure sensitive data is deleted after a retention period.\n\n### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"item1\",\n  \"name\": \"example\",\n  \"ttl\": 3600  // This item will expire in 1 hour (3600 seconds)\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- TTL helps automate data lifecycle management.\n- It reduces manual cleanup and storage costs.\n- TTL is non-blocking and deletion is handled asynchronously.\n\nFor more details, see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/time-to-live).",

        "answer": "**Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB**\n\nIndexing in Azure Cosmos DB is the process of automatically creating and maintaining indexes on data stored within a container. This enables efficient and fast query performance without requiring manual index management.\n\n### How Indexing Works in Cosmos DB\n\n- **Automatic Indexing:** By default, Cosmos DB automatically indexes all properties of items in a container, regardless of their structure. This means you can query any property without pre-defining indexes.\n- **Indexing Policy:** You can customize the indexing behavior using an indexing policy. This allows you to:\n  - Include or exclude specific paths (properties) from being indexed.\n  - Choose between consistent, lazy, or no indexing modes.\n  - Specify index types (e.g., range, spatial, composite).\n- **Types of Indexes:**\n  - **Range Indexes:** Support efficient queries on numeric, string, and date values.\n  - **Spatial Indexes:** Enable efficient queries on geospatial data.\n  - **Composite Indexes:** Optimize performance for queries involving multiple properties.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Performance:** Indexing ensures queries are served quickly, typically in milliseconds, regardless of the data size.\n- **Flexibility:** No need to manage or update indexes manually as your data model evolves.\n- **Cost Efficiency:** You can exclude rarely queried properties from indexing to save on storage and throughput.\n\n### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"indexingMode\": \"consistent\",\n  \"includedPaths\": [\n    { \"path\": \"/*\" }\n  ],\n  \"excludedPaths\": [\n    { \"path\": \"/nonIndexedProperty/?\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis policy indexes all properties except `nonIndexedProperty`.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIndexing in Cosmos DB is automatic and customizable, enabling fast and flexible queries on your data while minimizing manual management.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### How Cosmos DB Handles Conflicts in Multi-Master Replication\n\nAzure Cosmos DB supports **multi-master replication**, allowing writes to be made in any region. This introduces the possibility of **conflicts** when the same item is modified concurrently in different regions. Cosmos DB provides robust conflict resolution mechanisms to handle such scenarios:\n\n#### 1. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**\n\nCosmos DB offers two built-in conflict resolution policies:\n\n- **Last Write Wins (LWW):**\n  - By default, Cosmos DB uses the Last Write Wins policy.\n  - Each document has a system-defined property called `_ts` (timestamp) or a user-defined property (if specified).\n  - When a conflict occurs, the version with the highest value for the conflict resolution property (e.g., latest timestamp) is chosen as the winner.\n  - This approach is simple and efficient but may result in lost updates if not carefully managed.\n\n- **Custom Conflict Resolution (User-Defined):**\n  - You can specify a custom property (e.g., `version`, `updatedAt`) for conflict resolution instead of the default `_ts`.\n  - This allows more control over how conflicts are resolved, such as using application-specific logic.\n\n#### 2. **Manual Conflict Resolution**\n\n- If you require more granular control, Cosmos DB allows you to **access and resolve conflicts manually**.\n- Conflicting items are stored in a special **conflicts feed**.\n- Your application can read from this feed and apply custom logic to resolve conflicts (e.g., merging changes, prompting users, etc.).\n- Once resolved, you can update the item in the container and remove the conflict from the feed.\n\n#### 3. **Conflict Detection**\n\n- Conflicts are detected at the item (document) level, based on the item's unique ID.\n- When two or more regions write to the same item concurrently, Cosmos DB detects the conflict during replication.\n\n#### 4. **Conflict Resolution Workflow**\n\n1. **Write operations** occur in multiple regions.\n2. **Replication** synchronizes changes across regions.\n3. If the same item is updated in different regions before replication, a **conflict** is detected.\n4. Cosmos DB applies the configured **conflict resolution policy** (LWW or custom).\n5. Optionally, unresolved conflicts are exposed in the **conflicts feed** for manual resolution.\n\n#### 5. **Best Practices**\n\n- Choose the conflict resolution policy that best fits your application's consistency and business requirements.\n- Use manual conflict resolution for complex scenarios where automatic policies are insufficient.\n- Monitor the conflicts feed to detect and resolve conflicts proactively.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Azure Cosmos DB Multi-master Conflict Resolution Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/conflict-resolution)\n```\n",

Write a Conflict Resolution Stored Procedure\n\n- The stored procedure must accept two parameters:\n  - `conflicts`: An array of conflicting documents.\n  - `context`: The context object for the operation.\n- The stored procedure should contain logic to resolve the conflict (e.g., merge fields, select based on custom logic).\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nfunction resolveConflicts(conflicts, context) {\n    // Example: Prefer document with highest 'version' property\n    let winner = conflicts[0];\n    for (let i = 1; i < conflicts.length; i++) {\n        if (conflicts[i].version > winner.version) {\n            winner = conflicts[i];\n        }\n    }\n    // Replace the conflicting document with the winner\n    var collection = context.getCollection();\n    var accepted = collection.replaceDocument(winner._self, winner, function(err) {\n        if (err) throw err;\n    });\n    if (!accepted) throw new Error(\"Failed to resolve conflict.\");\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Register the Stored Procedure\n\n- Deploy the stored procedure to your Cosmos DB container using the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or SDK.\n\n#### 4. Configure the Container to Use the Stored Procedure\n\n- When creating or updating the container, set the `conflictResolutionPolicy` to reference your stored procedure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conflictResolutionPolicy\": {\n    \"mode\": \"Custom\",\n    \"conflictResolutionProcedure\": \"dbs/<db>/colls/<coll>/sprocs/<sprocName>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Monitor and Test\n\n- Test your conflict resolution logic by simulating concurrent writes.\n- Monitor the `conflicts` feed to ensure conflicts are being resolved as expected.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Azure Cosmos DB conflict resolution documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/conflict-resolution)\n- [Custom conflict resolution with stored procedures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/conflict-resolution#custom-conflict-resolution)\n```\n",

        "question": "What are the implications of different consistency levels on latency and throughput?",
        "answer": "### Implications of Different Consistency Levels on Latency and Throughput in Azure Cosmos DB\n\nAzure Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels, each with distinct trade-offs between **latency**, **throughput**, and **data consistency**:\n\n#### 1. Strong Consistency\n- **Latency:** Highest latency, especially for globally distributed applications, because reads must wait for data to be committed across all replicas.\n- **Throughput:** Lower throughput due to coordination overhead.\n- **Implication:** Guarantees linearizability but at the cost of performance.\n\n#### 2. Bounded Staleness\n- **Latency:** Lower than strong consistency, but higher than session or eventual. Reads may be delayed up to the configured staleness window.\n- **Throughput:** Higher than strong, but still limited by the need to track staleness.\n- **Implication:** Offers predictable consistency with moderate performance impact.\n\n#### 3. Session Consistency\n- **Latency:** Low latency for operations within the same session.\n- **Throughput:** High throughput, as reads are served from the nearest replica for the session.\n- **Implication:** Ideal for user-centric applications; balances consistency and performance.\n\n#### 4. Consistent Prefix\n- **Latency:** Comparable to session consistency; low latency as long as reads are from the nearest replica.\n- **Throughput:** High throughput.\n- **Implication:** Ensures order of writes is preserved, suitable for scenarios where order matters but strict consistency is not required.\n\n#### 5. Eventual Consistency\n- **Latency:** Lowest latency, as reads are served from any replica without coordination.\n- **Throughput:** Highest throughput, minimal coordination overhead.\n- **Implication:** Best for scenarios where absolute consistency is not required, maximizing performance.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Consistency Level    | Latency        | Throughput      | Use Case Example                        |\n|--------------------- |---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Strong               | Highest       | Lowest          | Financial transactions                  |\n| Bounded Staleness    | High          | Moderate        | Collaborative apps with relaxed ordering|\n| Session              | Low           | High            | User profile/data per session           |\n| Consistent Prefix    | Low           | High            | Event logging, ordered feeds            |\n| Eventual             | Lowest        | Highest         | Social media feeds, cache data          |\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nChoosing a lower consistency level (eventual, session, consistent prefix) reduces latency and increases throughput, but at the cost of weaker consistency guarantees. Higher consistency levels (strong, bounded staleness) increase latency and reduce throughput, but provide stronger data consistency. The optimal choice depends on your application's requirements for consistency versus performance.",

        "question": "How does Cosmos DB guarantee low latency at the 99th percentile?",
        "answer": "Cosmos DB guarantees low latency at the 99th percentile through a combination of architectural and operational strategies:\n\n## 1. **Global Distribution and Multi-Region Replication**\n- **Data is automatically replicated** across multiple Azure regions, allowing reads and writes to occur in the region closest to the user.\n- **Multi-master replication** enables low-latency writes from any region, reducing round-trip time.\n\n## 2. **Partitioning and Horizontal Scalability**\n- **Data is partitioned** using partition keys, distributing workload evenly across physical partitions.\n- **Automatic scaling** of throughput and storage ensures that no single partition becomes a bottleneck.\n\n## 3. **SSD-backed Storage and Indexing**\n- **All data is stored on SSDs**, ensuring fast read and write operations.\n- **Automatic indexing** of all data without requiring schema or index management, enabling quick query execution.\n\n## 4. **Request Routing and Locality**\n- **Requests are routed** to the nearest data center, minimizing network latency.\n- **Consistent hashing** ensures that requests are efficiently mapped to the correct partition.\n\n## 5. **Resource Governance and Isolation**\n- **Provisioned throughput (RU/s)** is reserved per container or database, guaranteeing resources are available even during peak loads.\n- **Isolation of workloads** prevents noisy neighbor issues, maintaining consistent performance.\n\n## 6. **Optimized Protocols and APIs**\n- **Direct TCP connections** and optimized wire protocols reduce serialization and deserialization overhead.\n- **SDKs and APIs** are designed to minimize client-side latency.\n\n## 7. **Monitoring and Adaptive Algorithms**\n- **Continuous monitoring** of latency and throughput allows Cosmos DB to adaptively rebalance partitions and resources.\n- **Hot partition detection** and mitigation strategies ensure even distribution of load.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nCosmos DB’s combination of global distribution, partitioning, SSD-backed storage, resource governance, and intelligent routing ensures that 99% of requests complete within single-digit millisecond latency, even at scale. This is validated by SLAs and continuous monitoring, making Cosmos DB suitable for latency-sensitive, globally distributed applications.",

However, it comes with several limitations compared to provisioned throughput mode:\n\n1. **Maximum Storage Limit**  \n   - Each serverless container or database is limited to **50 GB** of storage.\n\n2. **Throughput Constraints**  \n   - Serverless is not suitable for high-throughput workloads. There are **limits on request units per second (RU/s)**, which can impact performance for heavy or bursty workloads.\n\n3. **No Autoscale or Manual Provisioning**  \n   - You cannot use **autoscale** or **manually provisioned throughput** with serverless accounts.\n\n4. **Feature Restrictions**  \n   - Some features are **not supported** in serverless mode, such as:\n     - Multi-region writes\n     - Analytical store (for Azure Synapse Link)\n     - Continuous backup\n     - Dedicated gateway\n     - Materialized views\n\n5. **Account and Region Limitations**  \n   - Serverless accounts can only be created in **specific Azure regions**.\n   - **Multi-region replication** is not supported; serverless accounts are **single-region only**.\n\n6. **Pricing Model**  \n   - Costs are based on the **total number of request units (RUs) consumed** and storage used, which may not be cost-effective for consistently high or predictable workloads.\n\n7. **API Support**  \n   - Serverless mode is **not available for all Cosmos DB APIs**.

        "answer": "### How Cosmos DB Supports ACID Transactions\n\nAzure Cosmos DB provides **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** guarantees for transactions within a logical partition. Here’s how it achieves this:\n\n#### 1. **Single-Item Operations**\n- Every single-item operation (such as insert, update, delete on a document) is **ACID-compliant** by default.\n- These operations are atomic, isolated, and durable, ensuring strong consistency within the item.\n\n#### 2. **Transactional Batches (Stored Procedures and Bulk Operations)**\n- **Transactional batch operations** can be performed using stored procedures or the transactional batch API.\n- All operations within a batch must target items within the **same logical partition key**.\n- The entire batch is executed as a single transaction:\n  - **Atomicity:** All operations in the batch either succeed or fail together.\n  - **Consistency:** The state is consistent before and after the transaction.\n  - **Isolation:** No intermediate state is visible to other operations.\n  - **Durability:** Once committed, changes are permanent.\n\n#### 3. **Isolation Level**\n- Cosmos DB provides **snapshot isolation** for transactional batches, preventing dirty reads and ensuring repeatable reads within the transaction.\n\n#### 4. **Distributed Transactions**\n- **ACID guarantees are limited to a single logical partition.**\n- Multi-partition transactions are not natively supported with full ACID semantics, but you can implement eventual consistency or use application-level coordination for cross-partition scenarios.\n\n#### 5. **Consistency Levels**\n- Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels (Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, Eventual).\n- ACID guarantees are maintained within the chosen consistency level for transactional operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Operation Type                  | ACID Support | Scope                |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| Single-item CRUD                | Yes          | Any partition        |\n| Transactional batch/stored proc | Yes          | Single partition key |\n| Multi-partition transaction     | No*          | N/A                  |\n\n\\*Full ACID support is not available for multi-partition transactions.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Azure Cosmos DB: Transactional batch operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/transactional-batch)\n- [Azure Cosmos DB: Consistency levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels)",

        "question": "What is the impact of hot partitions and how can you mitigate them?",
        "answer": "### Impact of Hot Partitions in Azure Cosmos DB\n\n**Hot partitions** occur when a disproportionate amount of requests (reads/writes) are directed to a small subset of logical partitions. This can lead to:\n\n- **Throughput throttling:** Requests to hot partitions may exceed the provisioned RU/s (Request Units per second) for those partitions, resulting in 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.\n- **Increased latency:** Overloaded partitions can slow down response times.\n- **Resource underutilization:** Other partitions may remain idle, wasting provisioned throughput.\n- **Potential scaling issues:** Hot partitions can limit the ability to scale out effectively, as the bottleneck remains on specific partitions.\n\n---\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n1. **Choose an Effective Partition Key**\n   - Select a partition key with high cardinality and even value distribution.\n   - Avoid keys with skewed access patterns (e.g., `country`, `status`).\n\n2. **Monitor Partition Metrics**\n   - Use Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB metrics to identify partition key distribution and hot partitions.\n   - Track metrics like `Normalized RU Consumption` and `Logical Partition Key RU Consumption`.\n\n3. **Repartition Your Data**\n   - If hot partitions are detected, consider redesigning your partition key.\n   - Use synthetic or composite keys (e.g., `userId#orderId`) to increase cardinality.\n\n4. **Leverage Bulk Operations and Batching**\n   - Distribute bulk writes/reads across multiple partition keys to avoid concentrating load.\n\n5. **Implement Data Archiving or TTL**\n   - Use Time-to-Live (TTL) to automatically delete old data, reducing the load on hot partitions.\n\n6. **Increase Provisioned Throughput**\n   - As a short-term fix, increase RU/s to handle spikes, but this does not solve the underlying partitioning issue.\n\n---\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you use `userId` as a partition key, and a few users generate most of the traffic. This causes hot partitions. Switching to a composite key like `userId#timestamp` can spread the workload more evenly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nHot partitions degrade performance and resource efficiency in Cosmos DB. Mitigate them by carefully selecting and monitoring partition keys, redistributing data, and using features like TTL and batching to balance the workload.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n## Using Stored Procedures, Triggers, and UDFs in Azure Cosmos DB\n\nAzure Cosmos DB supports server-side programming through **Stored Procedures**, **Triggers**, and **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**, all written in JavaScript. These allow you to encapsulate logic and execute it directly within the Cosmos DB database engine, reducing client-server round trips and enabling transactional operations.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Stored Procedures\n\n- **Definition**: Encapsulate a sequence of operations (CRUD, business logic) that execute atomically within a single partition.\n- **Use Cases**: Batch inserts/updates, complex transactions, data validation.\n- **Creation**: Register JavaScript code as a stored procedure in a container.\n\n**Example: Registering a Stored Procedure**\n```javascript\n// JavaScript code for a stored procedure\nfunction bulkInsert(docs) {\n    var context = getContext();\n    var collection = context.getCollection();\n    var count = 0;\n\n    if (!docs) throw new Error(\"No documents provided\");\n\n    var docsLength = docs.length;\n\n    function insertDocument(i) {\n        if (i >= docsLength) {\n            context.getResponse().setBody(count);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        var isAccepted = collection.createDocument(\n            collection.getSelfLink(),\n            docs[i],\n            function (err, docCreated) {\n                if (err) throw err;\n                count++;\n                insertDocument(i + 1);\n            }\n        );\n\n        if (!isAccepted) context.getResponse().setBody(count);\n    }\n\n    insertDocument(0);\n}\n```\n\n**Register via Azure Portal, SDK, or CLI**.\n\n**Execute via SDK (e.g., Node.js):**\n```javascript\nconst { CosmosClient } = require(\"@azure/cosmos\");\nconst client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, key });\nconst container = client.database(\"db\").container(\"container\");\n\nconst { resource } = await container.scripts.storedProcedure(\"bulkInsert\").execute(\n    partitionKey,\n    [arrayOfDocs]\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Triggers\n\n- **Definition**: JavaScript functions that execute automatically before (**pre-trigger**) or after (**post-trigger**) a document operation (create, update, delete).\n- **Use Cases**: Data validation, automatic field population, auditing.\n- **Creation**: Register trigger code in the container.\n\n**Example: Pre-Trigger for Validation**\n```javascript\nfunction validateDocument() {\n    var context = getContext();\n    var request = context.getRequest();\n    var docToCreate = request.getBody();\n\n    if (!docToCreate.name) {\n        throw new Error(\"Document must have a 'name' property.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Attach trigger during operation:**\n```javascript\nawait container.items.create(\n    { id: \"1\", name: \"Item1\" },\n    { preTriggerInclude: [\"validateDocument\"] }\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)\n\n- **Definition**: Custom JavaScript functions used in SQL queries for computations or transformations.\n- **Use Cases**: Custom filtering, string manipulation, calculations.\n- **Creation**: Register UDF code in the container.\n\n**Example: UDF to Check String Prefix**\n```javascript\nfunction startsWith(input, prefix) {\n    return input && input.indexOf(prefix) === 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Register and use in a query:**\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM c WHERE udf.startsWith(c.name, \"A\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points**\n\n- All server-side logic is scoped to a single partition key value.\n- Register and manage these objects via Azure Portal, SDKs, or ARM templates.\n- Use them to optimize performance, enforce business rules, and enable transactional behavior.\n\n**References:**\n- [Azure Cosmos DB Server-side Programming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/server-side-programming)\n- [Stored Procedures, Triggers, and UDFs in Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-write-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs)\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown\n## Cost Optimization Strategies for Azure Cosmos DB\n\nOptimizing costs in Azure Cosmos DB requires a combination of architectural choices, configuration tuning, and ongoing monitoring. Here are advanced strategies to help minimize expenses while maintaining performance and reliability:\n\n### 1. **Choose the Right API and Data Model**\n- Select the most appropriate API (Core (SQL), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table) for your workload.\n- Design your data model to minimize the number of RU/s (Request Units per second) consumed per operation (e.g., avoid large documents, denormalize where appropriate).\n\n### 2. **Provisioned Throughput vs. Serverless**\n- **Provisioned Throughput:** Best for predictable, high-volume workloads. Right-size RU/s to match actual usage and avoid over-provisioning.\n- **Autoscale:** Use autoscale to automatically adjust RU/s based on workload, paying only for what you use (within a defined range).\n- **Serverless:** Ideal for infrequent or unpredictable workloads, as you pay only for consumed RUs.\n\n### 3. **Partitioning Strategy**\n- Choose a partition key that evenly distributes data and workload to avoid hot partitions, which can force over-provisioning.\n- Monitor partition usage and split or redesign as needed.\n\n### 4. **Optimize RU Consumption**\n- Use efficient queries (avoid cross-partition queries, use filters and projections).\n- Minimize the number and size of stored items.\n- Use indexing policies to include only necessary properties, reducing write and storage costs.\n- Use bulk operations where possible.\n\n### 5. **Data Lifecycle Management**\n- Implement TTL (Time to Live) policies to automatically delete obsolete data and reduce storage costs.\n- Archive cold data to cheaper storage solutions (e.g., Azure Blob Storage).\n\n### 6. **Multi-Region Replication**\n- Only enable multi-region writes or reads if required.\n- Choose regions close to your users to minimize latency and egress costs.\n- Regularly review and optimize the number and location of replicas.\n\n### 7. **Monitor and Analyze Usage**\n- Use Azure Cost Management and Cosmos DB metrics to track RU/s consumption, storage, and regional usage.\n- Set up alerts for unusual spikes in usage or costs.\n\n### 8. **Optimize Indexing**\n- Customize indexing policies to exclude unnecessary properties or paths.\n- Use \"lazy\" or \"none\" indexing modes for write-heavy workloads where immediate query consistency is not required.\n\n### 9. **Leverage Reserved Capacity**\n- Purchase reserved capacity for predictable workloads to receive significant discounts over pay-as-you-go pricing.\n\n### 10. **Review Consistency Levels**\n- Use the lowest acceptable consistency level for your application to reduce RU consumption and replication costs.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Azure Cosmos DB Cost Optimization Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/cost-management)\n- [Best Practices for Provisioned Throughput](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/provisioned-throughput-best-practices)\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown\nTo enable and use Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) in Azure Cosmos DB, follow these steps:\n\n## 1. Enable Point-in-Time Restore\n\n- **During Account Creation:**\n  - In the Azure portal, when creating a new Cosmos DB account, under the **Backup Policy** section, select **Continuous** mode. This enables PITR.\n- **For Existing Accounts:**\n  - PITR can only be enabled on new accounts. You cannot enable it on existing accounts.\n\n## 2. How Point-in-Time Restore Works\n\n- With PITR, Cosmos DB automatically maintains a continuous backup of your data.\n- You can restore your data to any point in time within the retention period (up to 30 days).\n\n## 3. Restoring Data\n\n- In the Azure portal, go to your Cosmos DB account with PITR enabled.\n- Select **Restore** from the menu.\n- Choose the desired **timestamp** within the retention window.\n- Specify a **new account name** for the restored data (restoration creates a new Cosmos DB account).\n- Select the **region** and **resource group** for the new account.\n- Review and confirm the restore operation.\n\n## 4. Considerations\n\n- PITR is only available for accounts using the **Continuous backup** policy.\n- You cannot restore to the original account; a new account is always created.\n- PITR supports all API types (Core (SQL), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table).\n\n## 5. Example (Portal Steps)\n\n1. Go to your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal.\n2. Click on **Restore** in the left menu.\n3. Select the **restore point** (date and time).\n4. Enter the **new account name** and select the **region**.\n5.

        "answer": "Azure Cosmos DB is a schema-agnostic (schema-less) NoSQL database. This means it does not enforce any schema on the data stored within its containers (collections). Here’s how Cosmos DB handles schema changes:\n\n- **No Schema Enforcement:** You can store documents with different structures (schemas) in the same container. Cosmos DB does not require you to define a schema before inserting data.\n- **Flexible Data Model:** You can add, remove, or modify properties in your JSON documents at any time without any impact on the existing data or the need for database migrations.\n- **Application Responsibility:** Since Cosmos DB does not enforce schemas, it is up to the application to handle any logic related to schema validation, data consistency, or transformation.\n- **Indexing:** Cosmos DB automatically indexes all properties by default, so new properties added to documents are automatically indexed unless you have defined a custom indexing policy.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n// Document 1\n{\n  \"id\": \"1\",\n  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n  \"age\": 30\n}\n\n// Document 2 (different schema)\n{\n  \"id\": \"2\",\n  \"firstName\": \"Bob\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nCosmos DB allows you to evolve your data model easily by simply inserting documents with new or modified structures.

        "question": "How do you perform cross-partition queries in Cosmos DB?",
        "answer": "To perform cross-partition queries in Azure Cosmos DB, you need to understand how Cosmos DB partitions data and how queries interact with these partitions.\n\n### How Cross-Partition Queries Work\n\nCosmos DB distributes data across logical partitions using a **partition key**. When you run a query that doesn't specify a partition key value (or the query needs to access data from multiple partitions), Cosmos DB executes the query across all relevant partitions—this is called a **cross-partition query**.\n\n### Steps to Perform a Cross-Partition Query\n\n1. **Write Your Query**  \n   Use the SQL API or SDK to write your query as usual. For example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = 'active'\n   ```\n\n2. **Enable Cross-Partition Querying**  \n   - **Azure Portal**: When using Data Explorer, cross-partition queries are enabled by default.\n   - **SDKs**: Set the `EnableCrossPartitionQuery` (older SDKs) or `EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true` (newer SDKs use this by default) in your query options.\n\n   **Example in .NET SDK v3+**:\n   ```csharp\n   var queryDefinition = new QueryDefinition(\"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = @status\")\n       .WithParameter(\"@status\", \"active\");\n\n   var queryRequestOptions = new QueryRequestOptions\n   {\n       // PartitionKey = null // Omit or set to null to query across all partitions\n   };\n\n   var iterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<MyItem>(\n       queryDefinition,\n       requestOptions: queryRequestOptions);\n\n   while (iterator.HasMoreResults)\n   {\n       foreach (var item in await iterator.ReadNextAsync())\n       {\n           // Process item\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider RU Consumption and Query Performance**  \n   - Cross-partition queries can be more expensive and slower because they scan multiple partitions.\n   - Use filters that can reduce the number of partitions scanned.\n   - If possible, include the partition key in your query to limit the scope.\n\n4. **Handle Pagination**  \n   Results are paginated. Use continuation tokens provided by the SDK to retrieve all results.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Design your partition key** to minimize the need for cross-partition queries.\n- **Use filters** that can help Cosmos DB quickly eliminate partitions that don't contain relevant data.\n- **Monitor RU usage** to optimize query cost.\n\n### References\n\n- [Azure Cosmos DB documentation: Querying across partitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/query-partitioned-containers)\n- [SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-async-query)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo perform cross-partition queries in Cosmos DB, simply run your query without specifying a partition key. Ensure your SDK or tool supports cross-partition queries, and be mindful of the potential performance and cost implications.",

        "question": "What is the role of indexing policy in Cosmos DB?",
        "answer": "**Answer:**\n\nIn Azure Cosmos DB, the **indexing policy** determines how data is indexed within a container. Its primary role is to define which properties of documents are indexed, the types of indexes used (e.g., range, spatial), and how queries are optimized for performance and cost.\n\nKey points about indexing policy in Cosmos DB:\n\n- **Automatic Indexing:** By default, Cosmos DB automatically indexes all properties of documents, enabling fast and efficient queries without requiring manual index management.\n- **Custom Indexing:** You can customize the indexing policy to include or exclude specific properties, or to change the index types, which can help reduce storage costs and improve write performance.\n- **Query Optimization:** The indexing policy directly impacts query performance. Well-designed policies ensure that queries are served efficiently, while unnecessary indexes can be removed to optimize resource usage.\n- **Consistency and Flexibility:** Indexing policies can be changed at any time, and Cosmos DB will automatically update the indexes in the background without downtime.\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"indexingMode\": \"consistent\",\n  \"includedPaths\": [\n    { \"path\": \"/*\" }\n  ],\n  \"excludedPaths\": [\n    { \"path\": \"/nonIndexedProperty/*\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe indexing policy in Cosmos DB controls how and what data is indexed, directly affecting query performance, storage costs, and overall efficiency of the database. Customizing the policy allows you to tailor indexing to your application's specific needs.",

        "question": "How can you use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed?",
        "answer": "You can use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed to automatically process and react to changes (inserts and updates) in your Cosmos DB containers. Here’s how you can set this up:\n\n## Steps to Use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed\n\n1. **Create an Azure Function App**  \n   In the Azure Portal, create a new Function App or use an existing one.\n\n2. **Add a Cosmos DB Triggered Function**  \n   When adding a new function, choose the **Azure Cosmos DB trigger** template. This trigger listens to the Change Feed of a specified Cosmos DB container.\n\n3. **Configure the Trigger**  \n   You’ll need to provide:\n   - **Cosmos DB connection string** (or use a managed identity)\n   - **Database name**\n   - **Container name**\n   - **Lease container name** (a separate container to track progress)\n   - **Other optional settings** (like start from beginning, max items per invocation, etc.)\n\n   Example function signature in C#:\n   ```csharp\n   public static void Run(\n       [CosmosDBTrigger(\n           databaseName: \"MyDatabase\",\n           containerName: \"MyContainer\",\n           Connection = \"CosmosDBConnection\",\n           LeaseContainerName = \"leases\",\n           CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true)] IReadOnlyList<Document> input,\n       ILogger log)\n   {\n       foreach (var doc in input)\n       {\n           log.LogInformation($\"Document modified: {doc}\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Process the Changes**  \n   The function receives a batch of changed documents (inserts and updates). You can add your custom logic to process these changes, such as updating other systems, sending notifications, or data transformation.\n\n5. **Deploy and Monitor**  \n   Deploy your function and monitor its execution using Azure Monitor or Application Insights.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Change Feed** provides a persistent log of changes in your Cosmos DB container.\n- **Azure Functions** with the Cosmos DB trigger automatically scale and process changes in near real-time.\n- **Lease Container** is required to track which changes have been processed, supporting scale-out and checkpointing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Azure Cosmos DB trigger for Azure Functions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger)\n- [Change Feed in Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy using the Cosmos DB trigger in Azure Functions, you can easily build serverless, event-driven architectures that respond to data changes in Cosmos DB, enabling real-time processing and integration scenarios.",
