Only the filtered data is retrieved, which can improve performance for large datasets.\n\n#### 3. **Use Case**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Suitable for in-memory collections like arrays, lists, or other data structures.\n   - **IQueryable**: Suitable for querying data from external sources like databases using LINQ-to-SQL or Entity Framework.\n\n#### 4. **Deferred Execution**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Supports deferred execution, but the query is executed in memory.\n   - **IQueryable**: Also supports deferred execution, but the query is translated into a database-specific query (e.g., SQL) and executed on the server.\n\n#### 5. **Query Customization**\n   - **IEnumerable**: LINQ queries are executed in memory, and the filtering logic is applied after retrieving all the data.\n   - **IQueryable**: LINQ queries are translated into SQL or other query languages, allowing the filtering logic to be applied at the data source.\n\n#### 6. **Performance**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Less efficient for large datasets as it retrieves all data into memory before applying filters.\n   - **IQueryable**: More efficient for large datasets as it retrieves only the required data from the source.\n\n#### Example"

It allows you to dynamically obtain information about assemblies, modules, and types, such as classes, methods, properties, fields, and events. Reflection is part of the `System.Reflection` namespace.\n\n#### Key Features of Reflection:\n1. **Type Inspection**: Retrieve information about the structure of types, such as their methods, properties, fields, and events.\n2. **Dynamic Invocation**: Invoke methods or access fields and properties dynamically at runtime.\n3. **Assembly Loading**: Load assemblies and inspect their contents.\n4. **Custom Attributes**: Access custom attributes applied to types, methods, or properties.\n\n#### Common Use Cases:\n- Building frameworks or libraries that need to work with unknown types at runtime.\n- Creating dynamic applications, such as plugins or dependency injection systems.\n- Performing runtime type discovery and metadata analysis.\n- Accessing private members (though this should generally be avoided for security and maintainability reasons).\n\n#### Example of Using Reflection:"

              "content": "### Async Streams in C# and How They Work\n\nAsync streams in C# are a feature introduced in C# 8.0 that allow asynchronous iteration over a sequence of data. They combine the concepts of asynchronous programming (`async/await`) with the ability to work with streams of data using `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n1. **`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`**:\n   - Async streams are based on the `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` interface, which represents an asynchronous sequence of elements.\n   - It works similarly to `IEnumerable<T>` but allows asynchronous iteration using `await foreach`.\n\n2. **`await foreach`**:\n   - To consume an async stream, you use the `await foreach` loop, which asynchronously retrieves elements from the stream one at a time.\n   - This is particularly useful when dealing with data sources that produce elements over time, such as reading data from a network, file, or database.\n\n3. **Asynchronous Iterators**:\n   - You can create an async stream by defining an asynchronous iterator method using the `async` modifier and the `yield return` statement.\n   - The method must return `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`.\n\n#### How Async Streams Work:\n1. **Producer**:\n   - The producer generates data asynchronously and yields it using `yield return`.\n   - The method can use `await` to perform asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching data from an API or database).\n\n2. **Consumer**:\n   - The consumer uses `await foreach` to asynchronously retrieve and process each item in the stream.\n   - The loop waits for each element to be produced before continuing.\n\n#### Example:"

This means two record instances are considered equal if their properties have the same values, unlike classes which use reference-based equality by default.\n3. **Concise Syntax**: Records support a concise syntax for defining data models using positional parameters.\n4. **With Expressions**: Records support `with` expressions, allowing you to create a new record instance by copying an existing one with modifications to specific properties.\n\n#### Example of a Record:"

It schedules the task on the default `TaskScheduler` and uses the `ThreadPool` for execution.\n   - **`Task.Factory.StartNew`**: It is a lower-level API introduced in .NET 4.0. It provides more control over task creation and scheduling but requires specifying options explicitly for common scenarios.\n\n### 2. **Ease of Use**\n   - **`Task.Run`**: Simplifies task creation for most common scenarios, such as running CPU-bound or I/O-bound operations asynchronously.\n   - **`Task.Factory.StartNew`**: Requires more parameters to configure the task, making it more verbose and complex for simple use cases.\n\n### 3. **Task Creation Options**\n   - **`Task.Run`**: Automatically uses `TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach`, which prevents child tasks from attaching to the parent task.\n   - **`Task.Factory.StartNew`**: Allows specifying `TaskCreationOptions`, giving more flexibility for advanced scenarios like long-running tasks, attached child tasks, etc.\n\n### 4. **Default Scheduler**\n   - **`Task.Run`**: Always uses the default `TaskScheduler` (usually the thread pool).\n   - **`Task.Factory.StartNew`**: Allows specifying a custom `TaskScheduler`, enabling tasks to run on a specific scheduler.\n\n### 5. **Long-Running Tasks**\n   - **`Task.Run`**: Not optimized for long-running tasks; it is designed for short-lived operations.\n   - **`Task.Factory.StartNew`**: Can be configured with `TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning` for tasks that are expected to run for an extended period, potentially creating a dedicated thread.\n\n### 6. **Continuation Behavior**\n   - **`Task.Run`**: Automatically detaches child tasks, ensuring they do not affect the parent task's lifecycle.\n   - **`Task.Factory.StartNew`**: By default, child tasks can attach to the parent task unless `TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach` is specified.\n\n### Example"

Once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string (e.g., concatenation, replacement) actually creates a new string object in memory.\n   - **`StringBuilder`**: `StringBuilder` is mutable. It allows modification of the string content without creating new objects, making it more efficient for scenarios involving frequent string manipulations.\n\n### 2. **Performance**:\n   - **`string`**: Since strings are immutable, operations like concatenation or appending create new string objects, which can lead to higher memory usage and slower performance when dealing with large or repetitive operations.\n   - **`StringBuilder`**: Designed for better performance in scenarios with frequent modifications. It modifies the existing object, avoiding the overhead of creating new objects.\n\n### 3. **Use Cases**:\n   - **`string`**: Best suited for scenarios where the text content is not expected to change frequently, such as storing constant values or performing simple operations.\n   - **`StringBuilder`**: Ideal for scenarios involving extensive string manipulations, such as building large strings dynamically, appending in loops, or performing multiple replacements.\n\n### 4. **Thread Safety**:\n   - **`string`**: Strings are inherently thread-safe because they are immutable.\n   - **`StringBuilder`**: Not thread-safe by default.
