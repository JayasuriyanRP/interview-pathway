    "answer": "```markdown **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that:\n\n> **A class should have only one reason to change.**\n\nIn other words, a class should have only one job or responsibility. If a class has more than one responsibility, those responsibilities become coupled, and changes to one responsibility may affect the other.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Violates SRP: Handles both employee data and report generation\nclass Employee {\n    void SaveEmployeeData() { /* ... */ }\n    void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Follows SRP: Each class has one responsibility\nclass Employee {\n    void SaveEmployeeData() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass ReportGenerator {\n    void GenerateReport(Employee employee) { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits of SRP:**\n\n- Easier to understand and maintain code\n- Improved code reusability\n- Reduced risk of unintended side effects when making changes",

It states:\n\n> **\"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\"**\n\nIn simpler terms, ISP suggests that it's better to have several small, specific interfaces rather than a single large, general-purpose interface. This way, classes only need to implement the methods that are relevant to them, making the code easier to maintain and extend.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Bad Example: A large interface\npublic interface IWorker {\n    void Work();\n    void Eat();\n}\n\npublic class Robot : IWorker {\n    public void Work() { /* ... */ }\n    public void Eat() { /* Not applicable for robots! */ }\n}\n\n// Good Example: Segregated interfaces\npublic interface IWorkable {\n    void Work();\n}\n\npublic interface IFeedable {\n    void Eat();\n}\n\npublic class Robot : IWorkable {\n    public void Work() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduces unnecessary dependencies\n- Makes code easier to understand and maintain\n- Allows for more flexible and reusable code",

    "answer": "```markdown A common code smell indicating a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the **\"God Class\"** (or **\"God Object\"**). This occurs when a class takes on too many responsibilities, often containing methods and data that should be split across multiple, more focused classes. Signs of this code smell include:\n\n- The class has an excessive number of methods and fields.\n- The class changes for multiple reasons.\n- The class handles unrelated functionalities (e.g., business logic, data access, and UI formatting).\n- Modifying one part of the class risks breaking unrelated features.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```java\npublic class ReportManager {\n    public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void saveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }\n    public void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `ReportManager` is responsible for report generation, database operations, and email sending—three distinct responsibilities.

It states that:\n\n> **Software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**\n\n**What does this mean?**\n- **Open for extension:** You should be able to add new functionality to a class or module.\n- **Closed for modification:** You should not have to change existing code to add new functionality.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n- It helps make your code more maintainable and flexible.\n- It reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding new features.\n- It encourages the use of abstraction, such as interfaces or abstract classes.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose you have a class that calculates the area of shapes:\n\n```csharp\n// Bad example: violates OCP\npublic class AreaCalculator {\n    public double CalculateArea(object shape) {\n        if (shape is Rectangle) {\n            Rectangle r = (Rectangle)shape;\n            return r.Width * r.Height;\n        } else if (shape is Circle) {\n            Circle c = (Circle)shape;\n            return Math.PI * c.Radius * c.Radius;\n        }\n        // More shapes?

    "answer": "```markdown To make a class open for extension but closed for modification, you should apply the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** from SOLID principles. This means you design your classes so that their behavior can be extended without altering their source code.\n\n### How to Achieve This\n\n1. **Use Abstraction (Interfaces or Abstract Classes):**\n   - Define abstract classes or interfaces for the core functionality.\n   - Write your code to depend on these abstractions rather than concrete implementations.\n\n2. **Leverage Polymorphism:**\n   - Allow new behaviors by creating subclasses or new implementations of the interface.\n   - Override or implement methods to extend functionality.\n\n3. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance:**\n   - Use composition to add new behaviors by combining objects, rather than modifying existing code.\n\n#### Example in C#\n\n```csharp\n// Abstraction\npublic interface IShape\n{\n    double Area();\n}\n\n// Existing implementation\npublic class Rectangle : IShape\n{\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n    public double Area() => Width * Height;\n}\n\n// New extension without modifying Rectangle\npublic class Circle : IShape\n{\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n    public double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n}\n```\n\n#### Example in Java\n\n```java\n// Abstraction\npublic interface Shape {\n    double area();\n}\n\n// Existing implementation\npublic class Rectangle implements Shape {\n    private double width, height;\n    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n    public double area() {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n}\n\n// New extension without modifying Rectangle\npublic class Circle implements Shape {\n    private double radius;\n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n    public double area() {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nBy programming to abstractions and using inheritance or composition, you can add new features or behaviors by extending the class, rather than changing its existing code.

    "answer": "```markdown The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is crucial for inheritance because it ensures that subclasses can be used in place of their parent classes without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without altering the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).\n\n### Why is LSP Important for Inheritance?\n\n- **Promotes Reliable Polymorphism:** LSP guarantees that inherited classes extend the base class without changing its behavior, allowing polymorphism to work as intended.\n- **Prevents Unexpected Behavior:** If a subclass violates LSP, substituting it for the parent class can introduce bugs or unexpected results, breaking the contract established by the base class.\n- **Facilitates Code Reusability:** When LSP is followed, code that works with the base class can seamlessly work with any subclass, making code more reusable and maintainable.\n- **Supports Open/Closed Principle:** By ensuring subclasses can stand in for their base classes, LSP helps keep systems open for extension but closed for modification.\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\nclass Bird {\n    public virtual void Fly() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass Ostrich : Bird {\n    public override void Fly() {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, substituting `Ostrich` for `Bird` violates LSP because ostriches cannot fly, but the base class expects all birds to fly.

    "answer": "```markdown The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** states that \"clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\" In the context of API design, this principle helps in the following ways:\n\n- **Focused Interfaces:** By splitting large, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, APIs become easier to understand and implement. Clients only need to interact with the methods relevant to them.\n- **Reduced Side Effects:** Changes to one part of an interface are less likely to impact unrelated clients, since each client depends only on the methods it uses.\n- **Improved Flexibility:** Smaller interfaces allow for more flexible and reusable code. Different clients can implement only the interfaces they need, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.\n- **Enhanced Testability:** With segregated interfaces, it’s easier to mock or stub dependencies during testing, as only the relevant parts of the API need to be implemented.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Violates ISP: Too broad\ninterface IWorker {\n    void Work();\n    void Eat();\n}\n\n// Adheres to ISP: Segregated interfaces\ninterface IWorkable {\n    void Work();\n}\n\ninterface IFeedable {\n    void Eat();\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle, APIs become more modular, easier to use, and less prone to breaking changes, resulting in a better developer experience and more robust systems.",

Details should depend on abstractions.\n- **Purpose:** It aims to reduce coupling between software modules by ensuring that both high-level and low-level modules depend on interfaces or abstract classes, not concrete implementations.\n- **Example:**\n  ```csharp\n  interface IMessageSender {\n      void Send(string message);\n  }\n\n  class EmailSender : IMessageSender {\n      public void Send(string message) { /* ... */ }\n  }\n\n  class Notification {\n      private IMessageSender _sender;\n      public Notification(IMessageSender sender) {\n          _sender = sender;\n      }\n      public void Notify(string message) {\n          _sender.Send(message);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### Dependency Injection (DI)\n\n- **Definition:** DI is a design pattern or technique used to implement DIP. It is a way of providing an object’s dependencies from the outside rather than having it construct them itself.\n- **Purpose:** It facilitates the decoupling suggested by DIP by injecting the required dependencies (usually abstractions) into a class, often via constructor, setter, or interface.\n- **Example:**\n  ```csharp\n  var emailSender = new EmailSender();\n  var notification = new Notification(emailSender); // Dependency is injected here\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences\n\n| Aspect              | Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) | Dependency Injection (DI)         |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| What is it?         | A design principle                   | A design pattern/technique        |\n| Purpose             | Decouple high-level and low-level modules via abstractions | Provide dependencies from outside the class |\n| How is it achieved? | By depending on abstractions         | By injecting dependencies         |\n| Relationship        | The \"why\" (reason for decoupling)    | The \"how\" (way to achieve decoupling) |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nDIP is a principle that guides you to depend on abstractions, not concretions.

Every time you add a new shape (e.g., Triangle), you must modify the `CalculateArea` method.\n- This leads to:\n  - **Fragile code:** Changes in one place can break existing functionality.\n  - **Difficult maintenance:** The class grows larger and harder to manage.\n  - **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle:** The calculator now knows about all shape types.\n\n#### OCP-Compliant Solution\n\nInstead, use polymorphism:\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class Shape\n{\n    public abstract double Area();\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : Shape\n{\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n    public override double Area() => Width * Height;\n}\n\npublic class Circle : Shape\n{\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n    public override double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n}\n\npublic class AreaCalculator\n{\n    public double CalculateArea(Shape shape)\n    {\n        return shape.Area();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- Now, to add a new shape, just create a new subclass of `Shape` and implement `Area()`.\n- The `AreaCalculator` class is **open for extension** (new shapes) but **closed for modification**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nViolating the Open/Closed Principle leads to code that is hard to maintain and extend. By following OCP, you can add new functionality without modifying existing, tested code.",

    "question": "How can applying SOLID principles improve code maintainability?",
    "answer": "```markdown Applying SOLID principles improves code maintainability in several ways:\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class or module has one responsibility, making it easier to understand, test, and modify without affecting other parts of the code.\n\n- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Code is open for extension but closed for modification. This allows you to add new features without changing existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses can replace their parent classes without breaking the application. This ensures that components can be reused and extended safely.\n\n- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients only depend on the interfaces they use, leading to more focused and easier-to-understand interfaces.\n\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. This makes it easier to change or replace components without affecting the rest of the system.\n\n**In summary:**  \nBy following SOLID principles, code becomes more modular, easier to test, extend, and refactor, which greatly enhances maintainability over time.",

Violating LSP can lead to several negative consequences:\n\n1. **Unexpected Behavior**\n   - Substituting a subclass for a superclass may cause the program to behave incorrectly or unpredictably, leading to bugs that are hard to trace.\n\n2. **Broken Inheritance Hierarchies**\n   - The \"is-a\" relationship is compromised. The subclass does not truly represent a specialized version of the superclass, which breaks the logic of inheritance.\n\n3. **Reduced Reusability**\n   - Code that depends on the superclass cannot safely use subclasses, limiting the ability to reuse code and components.\n\n4. **Difficult Maintenance**\n   - Developers must understand the specific behavior of each subclass, increasing the complexity and maintenance cost of the codebase.\n\n5. **Violation of Client Expectations**\n   - Clients using the superclass expect certain behaviors and guarantees. If a subclass violates these, it can lead to errors and unreliable software.\n\n6. **Increased Testing Effort**\n   - More extensive testing is required to ensure that subclasses do not break existing functionality, as assumptions about substitutability no longer hold.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Consequence                 | Description                                                  |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Unexpected Behavior         | Program may act incorrectly when subclass replaces superclass|\n| Broken Hierarchies          | Inheritance relationships lose meaning                       |\n| Reduced Reusability         | Subclasses can't be used interchangeably                     |\n| Difficult Maintenance       | Code becomes harder to understand and maintain               |\n| Violation of Expectations   | Clients can't rely on superclass guarantees                  |\n| Increased Testing Effort    | More tests needed to catch subclass-specific issues          |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nViolating the Liskov Substitution Principle undermines the reliability, maintainability, and scalability of object-oriented systems.

Fat interfaces can lead to:\n\n- **Unnecessary dependencies:** Clients depend on methods they don’t use.\n- **Difficult maintenance:** Changes to the interface can impact many unrelated classes.\n- **Violation of SOLID principles:** Specifically, it violates the Interface Segregation Principle.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\ninterface IMachine {\n    void Print();\n    void Scan();\n    void Fax();\n}\n```\nIf a class only needs to print, it still has to implement `Scan()` and `Fax()`.\n\n---\n\n### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n\nThe **Interface Segregation Principle** (the \"I\" in SOLID) states:\n\n> \"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\"\n\nInstead of one fat interface, ISP encourages splitting interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\ninterface IPrinter {\n    void Print();\n}\n\ninterface IScanner {\n    void Scan();\n}\n\ninterface IFax {\n    void Fax();\n}\n```\nNow, a class that only prints implements `IPrinter` and is not forced to implement unrelated methods.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Fat Interface                    | Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)         |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Large, all-encompassing          | Small, focused interfaces                    |\n| Forces clients to implement more | Clients only depend on what they use         |\n| Harder to maintain and extend    | Easier to maintain and extend                |\n| Violates SOLID                   | Follows SOLID                                |\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nFat interfaces do too much and force unnecessary dependencies, while the Interface Segregation Principle encourages creating focused interfaces so that classes only need to implement what they actually use.",

    "answer": "```markdown The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states that:\n\n> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  \n> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n\n### How DIP Helps in Unit Testing\n\n- **Enables Mocking and Stubbing:**  \n  By depending on abstractions (like interfaces), classes can accept mock or stub implementations during testing. This allows you to isolate the class under test and control its dependencies.\n\n- **Reduces Coupling:**  \n  High-level modules are not tightly coupled to concrete implementations. This makes it easier to substitute dependencies with test doubles, leading to more focused and reliable unit tests.\n\n- **Improves Testability:**  \n  Since dependencies are injected (often via constructor or setter), you can easily provide fake or mock objects in your tests, making it possible to test the class in isolation.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you have a `ReportGenerator` that depends on a `FileWriter`:\n\n```csharp\n// Without DIP\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    private FileWriter writer = new FileWriter();\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nTesting `ReportGenerator` is hard because it always uses the real `FileWriter`.\n\n**With DIP:**\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IWriter {\n    void Write(string content);\n}\n\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    private IWriter writer;\n    public ReportGenerator(IWriter writer) {\n        this.writer = writer;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nNow, in your unit test, you can inject a mock:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MockWriter : IWriter {\n    public string WrittenContent;\n    public void Write(string content) {\n        WrittenContent = content;\n    }\n}\n\n// In your test\nvar mockWriter = new MockWriter();\nvar generator = new ReportGenerator(mockWriter);\n// Test generator methods and verify mockWriter.WrittenContent\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Dependency Inversion Principle makes unit testing easier by allowing you to inject mock dependencies, isolate the class under test, and avoid side effects from real implementations.",

Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Applying SOLID Principles in Functional Programming\n\nWhile the **SOLID** principles were originally formulated for object-oriented programming (OOP), their core ideas can be adapted to functional programming (FP) paradigms as well. Here’s how each principle maps to FP:\n\n#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n- **OOP:** Each class should have one responsibility.\n- **FP:** Each function should do one thing and do it well. Pure functions naturally encourage single responsibility by focusing on a single operation without side effects.\n\n#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n- **OOP:** Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n- **FP:** Functions and data types can be extended using higher-order functions and composition. Instead of modifying existing code, new behavior is achieved by composing functions or using pattern matching with new cases.\n\n#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n- **OOP:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n- **FP:** This translates to using algebraic data types (ADTs) and ensuring that functions operating on these types can handle all possible cases. Polymorphism is achieved via parametric polymorphism (generics) and type classes, ensuring substitutability.\n\n#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n- **OOP:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n- **FP:** Functions should have minimal and precise input requirements. Instead of large records or complex parameter lists, FP favors small, composable functions with specific input types.\n\n#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n- **OOP:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions.\n- **FP:** Depend on higher-order functions and abstract data types. Instead of hard-coding dependencies, pass functions as arguments (dependency injection via functions), and use modules or type classes to abstract over behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| SOLID Principle | OOP Concept | FP Equivalent |\n|-----------------|-------------|--------------|\n| SRP | Single-responsibility classes | Pure, single-purpose functions |\n| OCP | Inheritance, interfaces | Function composition, ADTs |\n| LSP | Subtypes, inheritance | Parametric polymorphism, ADTs |\n| ISP | Fine-grained interfaces | Small, composable functions |\n| DIP | Interface abstraction | Higher-order functions, type classes |\n\n---\n\n#### **Example: Open/Closed Principle in FP (JavaScript)**\n\n```javascript\n// Closed for modification, open for extension via composition\nconst double = x => x * 2;\nconst increment = x => x + 1;\n\nconst process = x => increment(double(x)); // Compose functions\n\n// To extend, compose more functions\nconst square = x => x * x;\nconst extendedProcess = x => square(process(x));\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe SOLID principles, though rooted in OOP, can be effectively applied in functional programming by leveraging pure functions, composition, higher-order functions, and strong type systems. This leads to code that is modular, extensible, and maintainable—hallmarks of both SOLID and functional programming.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between SOLID principles and design patterns?",
    "answer": "```markdown The SOLID principles and design patterns are both foundational concepts in object-oriented software design, but they serve different purposes and have a complementary relationship:\n\n- **SOLID Principles** are a set of five guidelines (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) that help developers create code that is easy to maintain, extend, and refactor. They focus on the *qualities* of good software design.\n\n- **Design Patterns** are general, reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. Examples include Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns. They provide *templates* for solving specific design challenges.\n\n### Relationship\n\n- **Guidance vs. Implementation:** SOLID principles provide *guidance* on how to structure classes and relationships, while design patterns offer *concrete implementations* for recurring problems.\n- **Complementary:** Applying SOLID principles often leads to the discovery or use of design patterns. For example, following the Dependency Inversion Principle can lead to using the Dependency Injection pattern.\n- **Quality Assurance:** SOLID principles help ensure that the use of design patterns results in flexible and maintainable code, rather than rigid or overcomplicated structures.\n\n**In summary:**  \nSOLID principles are high-level design guidelines that promote good software architecture, while design patterns are proven solutions to specific design problems. Using SOLID principles often makes it easier to apply design patterns effectively, and design patterns can help realize the goals of SOLID principles in practical code.",

    "question": "How do SOLID principles help in reducing code coupling?",
    "answer": "```markdown The SOLID principles are a set of five design guidelines that help developers create software that is easier to maintain, extend, and refactor. One of their key benefits is the reduction of code coupling. Here’s how each principle contributes:\n\n### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n- **How it helps:** By ensuring that each class or module has only one reason to change, SRP keeps responsibilities separate. This minimizes dependencies between classes, reducing the ripple effect of changes.\n\n### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n- **How it helps:** Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new functionality by extending existing code rather than altering it, which avoids breaking dependent code and reduces tight coupling.\n\n### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n- **How it helps:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This allows components to interact through abstractions, not concrete implementations, lowering direct dependencies.\n\n### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n- **How it helps:** By splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, ISP ensures that classes only depend on the methods they actually use. This reduces unnecessary coupling to unused functionality.\n\n### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n- **How it helps:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This decouples the implementation details from the business logic, making it easier to swap out components.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe SOLID principles encourage the use of abstractions, separation of concerns, and minimal dependencies, all of which lead to lower code coupling.

    "question": "Can you explain how violating the Dependency Inversion Principle can lead to tight coupling?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly!\n\nThe **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states that:\n\n- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n\n### How Violating DIP Leads to Tight Coupling\n\nWhen DIP is violated, high-level modules (which contain business logic) directly depend on low-level modules (such as concrete classes for data access, logging, etc.). This creates **tight coupling** because:\n\n- **Direct Dependencies:** Changes in low-level modules force changes in high-level modules, making the system fragile and hard to maintain.\n- **Reduced Flexibility:** It becomes difficult to swap out low-level implementations (e.g., changing from a file logger to a database logger) without modifying high-level code.\n- **Difficult Testing:** High-level modules are harder to test in isolation because they are tied to specific implementations rather than abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Violates DIP: High-level class depends on a concrete class\npublic class ReportGenerator\n{\n    private FileLogger logger = new FileLogger();\n\n    public void Generate()\n    {\n        // ...\n        logger.Log(\"Report generated\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, `ReportGenerator` is tightly coupled to `FileLogger`. If you want to use a different logger, you must change `ReportGenerator`.\n\n#### With DIP\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ILogger\n{\n    void Log(string message);\n}\n\npublic class FileLogger : ILogger\n{\n    public void Log(string message) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class ReportGenerator\n{\n    private ILogger logger;\n\n    public ReportGenerator(ILogger logger)\n    {\n        this.logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public void Generate()\n    {\n        // ...\n        logger.Log(\"Report generated\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, `ReportGenerator` depends on the abstraction `ILogger`, not the concrete `FileLogger`. This reduces coupling and increases flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nViolating the Dependency Inversion Principle leads to tight coupling because high-level modules become dependent on the details of low-level modules, making the system rigid, harder to maintain, and less testable. DIP encourages depending on abstractions, which decouples modules and promotes a more flexible and maintainable codebase.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Anti-pattern Related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**\n\nA common anti-pattern associated with the Single Responsibility Principle is the **\"God Object\"** (also known as **\"God Class\"**).\n\n---\n\n### God Object Anti-pattern\n\n**Description:**  \nA God Object is a class that knows too much or does too much. It accumulates multiple responsibilities, violating SRP by handling various unrelated tasks. This makes the class large, complex, and difficult to maintain or extend.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```java\npublic class ReportManager {\n    public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void saveReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void printReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void emailReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void logActivity() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n*In this example, `ReportManager` handles report generation, saving, printing, emailing, and logging—multiple responsibilities bundled into one class.*\n\n---\n\n### Consequences of the God Object Anti-pattern\n\n- **Poor maintainability:** Changes in one responsibility may affect others.\n- **Low reusability:** Difficult to reuse parts of the class in other contexts.\n- **Hard to test:** Testing becomes complex due to intertwined responsibilities.\n- **Increased risk of bugs:** Modifications can introduce unintended side effects.\n\n---\n\n### How to Avoid\n\n- **Decompose responsibilities:** Split the class into smaller, focused classes, each handling a single responsibility.\n- **Apply SRP:** Ensure each class or module has one reason to change.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe God Object anti-pattern is a direct violation of the Single Responsibility Principle, leading to code that is hard to maintain, test, and extend. Always strive to keep classes focused and cohesive to adhere to SRP.",

    "question": "How can you use composition over inheritance to adhere to SOLID principles?",
    "answer": "```markdown Using Composition Over Inheritance to Adhere to SOLID Principles\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Composition over inheritance** is a design principle that suggests using object composition (i.e., assembling objects with desired behaviors) rather than relying solely on class inheritance. This approach helps you better adhere to the SOLID principles:\n\n### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n- **Composition** allows you to create small, focused classes with specific responsibilities.\n- You can assemble complex behaviors by combining these classes, ensuring each class has only one reason to change.\n\n### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n- With composition, you can extend a class’s behavior by adding new components, rather than modifying existing code.\n- This makes your code open for extension but closed for modification.\n\n### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n- Inheritance can sometimes lead to violations of LSP if subclasses do not behave as expected.\n- Composition avoids this by assembling objects with well-defined interfaces, ensuring substitutability.\n\n### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n- Composition encourages the use of small, specific interfaces.\n- Classes depend only on the functionality they need, rather than large, monolithic interfaces.\n\n### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n- Composition often uses dependency injection, where high-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.\n- This decouples components and makes the system more flexible.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have different types of notifications (Email, SMS, Push). Instead of using inheritance:\n\n```csharp\n// Inheritance approach (less flexible)\nclass Notification { ... }\nclass EmailNotification : Notification { ... }\nclass SMSNotification : Notification { ... }\n```\n\nUse composition:\n\n```csharp\ninterface INotificationSender\n{\n    void Send(string message);\n}\n\nclass EmailSender : INotificationSender\n{\n    public void Send(string message) { /* send email */ }\n}\n\nclass SMSSender : INotificationSender\n{\n    public void Send(string message) { /* send SMS */ }\n}\n\nclass Notification\n{\n    private readonly INotificationSender _sender;\n    public Notification(INotificationSender sender)\n    {\n        _sender = sender;\n    }\n    public void Notify(string message)\n    {\n        _sender.Send(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- You can add new notification types without modifying existing classes (OCP).\n- Each sender class has a single responsibility (SRP).\n- Notification depends on an abstraction, not a concrete class (DIP).\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nBy favoring composition over inheritance, you create flexible, maintainable, and SOLID-compliant code that is easier to extend and less prone to bugs caused by rigid inheritance hierarchies.",

    "answer": "```markdown Applying SOLID principles to legacy code can be challenging due to several factors:\n\n1. **Tightly Coupled Code**  \n   Legacy code often contains tightly coupled classes and modules, making it difficult to isolate responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle) or introduce abstractions (Dependency Inversion Principle) without significant refactoring.\n\n2. **Lack of Tests**  \n   Legacy systems frequently lack automated tests. Refactoring code to adhere to SOLID principles without tests increases the risk of introducing bugs, as there’s no safety net to verify behavior remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Monolithic Design**  \n   Large, monolithic classes or methods violate several SOLID principles. Breaking them down into smaller, more focused components can be complex and time-consuming.\n\n4. **Hidden Dependencies**  \n   Dependencies in legacy code are often implicit or scattered throughout the codebase, making it hard to identify and invert dependencies cleanly.\n\n5. **Resistance to Change**  \n   Legacy systems are usually critical to business operations. Stakeholders may be reluctant to approve major refactoring efforts due to the perceived risk and cost.\n\n6. **Lack of Documentation**  \n   Poor or outdated documentation makes it difficult to understand the intent and behavior of existing code, complicating efforts to refactor according to SOLID principles.\n\n7. **Backward Compatibility**  \n   Ensuring that changes do not break existing functionality or integrations can limit the extent to which SOLID principles can be applied.\n\n8. **Time and Resource Constraints**  \n   Refactoring legacy code to follow SOLID principles requires time and skilled developers, which may not always be available.\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Challenge                | Description                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tightly Coupled Code     | Hard to separate responsibilities and introduce abstractions                 |\n| Lack of Tests            | Increases risk of breaking functionality during refactoring                  |\n| Monolithic Design        | Difficult to decompose large classes/methods                                 |\n| Hidden Dependencies      | Hard to identify and invert dependencies                                     |\n| Resistance to Change     | Stakeholders may fear risk and cost                                         |\n| Lack of Documentation    | Hard to understand and safely modify code                                    |\n| Backward Compatibility   | Need to avoid breaking existing functionality                                |\n| Time/Resource Constraints| Refactoring requires significant investment                                  |\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n- Introduce automated tests before refactoring.\n- Apply SOLID principles incrementally, focusing on high-impact areas.\n- Use techniques like the Strangler Fig pattern to gradually replace legacy components.\n- Communicate risks and benefits to stakeholders to gain support.\n\nBy understanding these challenges, you can plan a more effective and safer transition towards SOLID-compliant code in legacy systems.",

    "answer": "```markdown The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In other words, interfaces should be **client-specific** rather than general-purpose.\n\n### How ISP Relates to Client-Specific Interfaces\n\n- **Client-specific interfaces** are designed to meet the needs of a particular client or group of clients.\n- ISP encourages splitting large, \"fat\" interfaces into smaller, more focused ones. This way, each client only knows about the methods that are relevant to it.\n- By adhering to ISP, you avoid situations where changes to an interface (for one client) inadvertently affect other clients that do not use those methods.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you have a `Machine` interface:\n\n```csharp\ninterface Machine {\n    void Print();\n    void Scan();\n    void Fax();\n}\n```\n\nA simple printer client only needs `Print()`.

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly!\n\n### Example of Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Violation\n\n#### Real-World System: Rectangle and Square Classes\n\nSuppose you are designing a graphics library with the following classes:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Rectangle\n{\n    public virtual int Width { get; set; }\n    public virtual int Height { get; set; }\n\n    public int GetArea()\n    {\n        return Width * Height;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Square : Rectangle\n{\n    public override int Width\n    {\n        set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }\n        get { return base.Width; }\n    }\n\n    public override int Height\n    {\n        set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }\n        get { return base.Height; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### How This Violates LSP\n\nThe **Liskov Substitution Principle** states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program.\n\nIn this example, `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`. However, a `Square` enforces that its width and height are always equal, while a `Rectangle` allows them to be different.\n\n**Problematic Scenario:**\n\n```csharp\nvoid SetWidthAndHeight(Rectangle rect)\n{\n    rect.Width = 5;\n    rect.Height = 10;\n    Console.WriteLine(rect.GetArea());\n}\n```\n\n- If you pass a `Rectangle`, the area will be `5 * 10 = 50`.\n- If you pass a `Square`, setting `Width = 5` sets both width and height to 5. Then setting `Height = 10` sets both to 10. The area becomes `10 * 10 = 100`.\n\nThis breaks the expectation that any `Rectangle` (including a `Square`) will behave the same way. Thus, substituting a `Square` for a `Rectangle` changes the program's behavior, violating LSP.\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Principle | Violation Example         | Why it Violates LSP                                      |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| LSP       | Rectangle/Square classes | Substituting Square for Rectangle changes expected logic |\n\n---\n\n**In real-world systems, such violations can lead to subtle bugs and maintenance headaches.** This is why careful design and adherence to SOLID principles are crucial in object-oriented programming.",

They play a crucial role in achieving **high cohesion** and **low coupling**:\n\n---\n\n### How SOLID Principles Promote High Cohesion and Low Coupling\n\n#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n- **High Cohesion:** By ensuring each class or module has only one responsibility, SRP keeps related functionalities together, making the code more focused and cohesive.\n- **Low Coupling:** When classes have a single responsibility, changes in one class are less likely to affect others, reducing dependencies.\n\n#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n- **High Cohesion:** Classes are designed to do their job well and can be extended without modifying existing code, keeping related behavior grouped.\n- **Low Coupling:** New functionality is added via extension, not modification, minimizing the impact on existing code and reducing interdependencies.\n\n#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n- **High Cohesion:** Subclasses maintain the behavior expected from their parent classes, ensuring logical grouping of related behaviors.\n- **Low Coupling:** Code using base classes or interfaces doesn’t need to know about specific subclasses, reducing direct dependencies.\n\n#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n- **High Cohesion:** Clients only depend on the methods they actually use, leading to more focused and cohesive interfaces.\n- **Low Coupling:** Smaller, specific interfaces mean that changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on others.\n\n#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n- **High Cohesion:** High-level modules are not concerned with low-level implementation details, allowing each module to focus on its core responsibility.\n- **Low Coupling:** By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, modules are less tightly bound to each other.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Principle | High Cohesion | Low Coupling |\n|-----------|:-------------:|:------------:|\n| SRP       | ✅            | ✅           |\n| OCP       | ✅            | ✅           |\n| LSP       | ✅            | ✅           |\n| ISP       | ✅            | ✅           |\n| DIP       | ✅            | ✅           |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nApplying SOLID principles leads to:\n- **High Cohesion:** Classes and modules are focused and logically organized.\n- **Low Coupling:** Components interact through well-defined interfaces and abstractions, minimizing dependencies.\n\nThis results in code that is easier to maintain, test, and extend.",

    "question": "What is the impact of SOLID principles on software scalability?",
    "answer": "```markdown The SOLID principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—have a significant positive impact on software scalability. Here’s how:\n\n## 1. Improved Maintainability\nBy enforcing clear responsibilities and modularity (Single Responsibility Principle), code becomes easier to understand, modify, and extend. This maintainability is crucial as systems grow in size and complexity.\n\n## 2. Easier Extension\nThe Open/Closed Principle encourages designing modules that can be extended without modifying existing code. This allows new features to be added with minimal risk of breaking existing functionality, which is essential for scaling software.\n\n## 3. Flexible Substitution\nThe Liskov Substitution Principle ensures that derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes. This flexibility supports the reuse and replacement of components as the system grows.\n\n## 4. Focused Interfaces\nThe Interface Segregation Principle leads to smaller, more specific interfaces. This reduces the impact of changes and allows different parts of the system to scale independently.\n\n## 5. Decoupled Architecture\nThe Dependency Inversion Principle promotes decoupling of high-level and low-level modules. This makes it easier to swap out implementations, integrate new technologies, and distribute components across different systems or services.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nApplying SOLID principles results in a codebase that is modular, flexible, and easier to maintain. This directly supports scalability, as the software can grow and adapt to new requirements or increased load without becoming fragile or overly complex.",

    "answer": "```markdown The SOLID principles and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle are both foundational concepts in software design, aiming to create maintainable, flexible, and robust code. Here’s how they relate:\n\n---\n\n### Relationship between SOLID and DRY\n\n- **Complementary Goals:**  \n  Both SOLID and DRY strive to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make code easier to understand and modify.\n\n- **DRY Principle:**  \n  DRY focuses specifically on eliminating repetition in code. When you find yourself copying and pasting code, DRY encourages you to refactor that logic into a single place (such as a method or class).\n\n- **SOLID Principles:**  \n  SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) that guide how to structure classes and interfaces for maximum flexibility and reusability.\n\n- **How SOLID Supports DRY:**  \n  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** By ensuring each class has one responsibility, you avoid duplicating logic across multiple classes.\n  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** By designing modules that are open for extension but closed for modification, you prevent the need to copy and modify code for new features.\n  - **Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion:** These principles encourage reusable, decoupled code, reducing the likelihood of repetition.\n\n- **Example:**  \n  If you violate SRP by putting multiple responsibilities in one class, you might end up duplicating similar logic in other classes. By adhering to SOLID, you naturally follow DRY.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Principle | Focus | How it Relates to DRY |\n|-----------|-------|----------------------|\n| DRY | Avoid code duplication | Directly prevents repeated code |\n| SOLID | Structure and design | Leads to less duplication through better design |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nApplying SOLID principles often leads to DRY code as a natural consequence. While DRY is about *what* to avoid (repetition), SOLID provides guidance on *how* to structure your code to achieve that goal and more.",

    "answer": "```markdown The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is the \"D\" in SOLID and states:\n\n> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  \n> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n\n### Role of Abstractions in DIP\n\nAbstractions (such as interfaces or abstract classes) play a central role in DIP by acting as a contract between high-level and low-level modules. Here’s how:\n\n- **Decoupling:** By depending on abstractions instead of concrete implementations, high-level modules are decoupled from the details of low-level modules. This means changes in low-level modules do not force changes in high-level modules.\n- **Flexibility:** Abstractions allow you to swap out implementations easily (e.g., for testing or extending functionality) without modifying the dependent code.\n- **Maintainability:** Code becomes easier to maintain and scale, as new implementations can be introduced without altering existing logic.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Abstraction\npublic interface IMessageSender\n{\n    void Send(string message);\n}\n\n// High-level module depends on abstraction\npublic class Notification\n{\n    private readonly IMessageSender _messageSender;\n\n    public Notification(IMessageSender messageSender)\n    {\n        _messageSender = messageSender;\n    }\n\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        _messageSender.Send(message);\n    }\n}\n\n// Low-level module implements abstraction\npublic class EmailSender : IMessageSender\n{\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        // Send email logic\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, both the high-level module (`Notification`) and the low-level module (`EmailSender`) depend on the abstraction (`IMessageSender`). This achieves the goals of the Dependency Inversion Principle.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nAbstractions in DIP serve as the glue that connects high-level and low-level modules, ensuring that both depend on contracts rather than concrete implementations, which leads to more robust, flexible, and maintainable code.",

    "answer": "```markdown To refactor code to follow the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**—which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification—you should design your code so that new functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code. Here’s how you can achieve this:\n\n### 1. Use Abstraction\n\n- **Define interfaces or abstract classes** for behaviors that may change.\n- **Program to abstractions**, not concrete implementations.\n\n```csharp\n// Before OCP\nclass Rectangle {\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n}\n\nclass AreaCalculator {\n    public double CalculateArea(Rectangle rectangle) {\n        return rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```csharp\n// After OCP\ninterface IShape {\n    double GetArea();\n}\n\nclass Rectangle : IShape {\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n    public double GetArea() => Width * Height;\n}\n\nclass Circle : IShape {\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n    public double GetArea() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n}\n\nclass AreaCalculator {\n    public double CalculateArea(IShape shape) {\n        return shape.GetArea();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can add new shapes without modifying `AreaCalculator`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Apply Polymorphism\n\n- Use **inheritance** or **composition** to allow new behaviors.\n- Avoid large `switch` or `if-else` statements that check for types.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Use Design Patterns\n\n- **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulate algorithms and make them interchangeable.\n- **Decorator Pattern**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Example Refactoring Steps\n\n1. **Identify** code that changes frequently.\n2. **Extract** varying behavior into new classes or methods.\n3. **Depend** on abstractions (interfaces/abstract classes).\n4. **Inject** new behavior via dependency injection or composition.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Step                  | Before OCP                    | After OCP (Refactored)         |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Adding new behavior   | Modify existing classes       | Add new classes implementing interfaces |\n| Type checks           | if-else/switch on types       | Polymorphism                  |\n| Extensibility         | Low                           | High                          |\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, your code will be easier to extend and maintain, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.",

    "question": "Can SOLID principles be applied to procedural programming? Why or why not?",
    "answer": "```markdown Yes, some SOLID principles can be applied to procedural programming, but not all of them fit perfectly. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n## Applicability of SOLID Principles in Procedural Programming\n\n**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  \nThis principle states that a module, class, or function should have only one reason to change. In procedural programming, you can apply SRP by ensuring that each function or procedure does one thing and does it well. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.\n\n**2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  \nOCP suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In procedural code, achieving this is more challenging since it lacks mechanisms like inheritance or interfaces. However, you can use techniques like function pointers, callbacks, or configuration files to allow extension without modifying existing code.\n\n**3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  \nLSP is inherently tied to object-oriented inheritance and polymorphism. Since procedural programming does not have these concepts, LSP does not directly apply.\n\n**4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  \nISP is about creating specific, fine-grained interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones. In procedural programming, this can be loosely interpreted as designing small, focused modules or sets of functions, but the lack of formal interfaces limits its applicability.\n\n**5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  \nDIP encourages depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. In procedural programming, you can mimic this by using function pointers or passing functions as parameters, but it is less natural and more cumbersome than in object-oriented languages.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Principle | Procedural Applicability | Notes |\n|-----------|-------------------------|-------|\n| SRP       | Yes                     | Use focused functions/modules |\n| OCP       | Partially               | Use callbacks, configuration |\n| LSP       | No                      | Requires inheritance/polymorphism |\n| ISP       | Partially               | Use small modules, no formal interfaces |\n| DIP       | Partially               | Use function pointers, less natural |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile some SOLID principles (especially SRP) can be adapted to procedural programming, others rely on object-oriented features and are not directly applicable. Procedural code can benefit from the spirit of SOLID—writing modular, maintainable, and extensible code—even if the principles are not followed to the letter.",

    "answer": "```markdown Balancing SOLID Principles with Performance Considerations\n==========================================================\n\nApplying the SOLID principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—leads to maintainable, flexible, and robust code. However, strict adherence can sometimes introduce performance overhead (e.g., due to abstraction layers, indirection, or increased object creation). Here’s how to balance SOLID principles with performance:\n\n1. **Profile Before Optimizing**\n   - Start by designing for clarity and maintainability using SOLID.\n   - Use profiling tools to identify real performance bottlenecks rather than assuming abstractions are the cause.\n\n2. **Prioritize Critical Paths**\n   - Apply SOLID rigorously in most of your codebase.\n   - In performance-critical sections (e.g., tight loops, hot paths), consider relaxing some principles if profiling shows a significant impact.\n\n3. **Minimize Over-Abstraction**\n   - Avoid unnecessary layers of abstraction, especially in high-frequency code.\n   - Use interfaces and dependency injection where flexibility is needed, but keep implementations as direct as possible in critical areas.\n\n4. **Leverage Language Features**\n   - Use language or framework features (e.g., sealed classes, structs, value types) that offer both abstraction and performance.\n   - Inline small methods or use value objects where appropriate.\n\n5. **Document Deviations**\n   - If you must break a SOLID principle for performance, document the reason clearly.\n   - Isolate such code to make future refactoring easier if requirements change.\n\n6. **Test and Refactor**\n   - Write tests to ensure that performance optimizations don’t break functionality.\n   - Refactor when performance constraints are relaxed or hardware improves.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Applying Dependency Inversion everywhere:\npublic interface IAdder {\n    int Add(int a, int b);\n}\npublic class Adder : IAdder {\n    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;\n}\n\n// In a performance-critical loop, direct use may be better:\npublic int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;\n```\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Principle           | Performance Impact      | Balancing Strategy                        |\n|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Single Responsibility | More classes, more calls | Group responsibilities in hot paths if needed |\n| Open/Closed         | More abstractions      | Limit inheritance in critical code        |\n| Liskov Substitution | Virtual calls          | Use sealed/final classes where possible   |\n| Interface Segregation | More interfaces       | Use concrete types in tight loops         |\n| Dependency Inversion | Indirection           | Direct instantiation in hot spots         |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSOLID principles and performance are not mutually exclusive.

    "question": "What is the relationship between SOLID principles and testability?",
    "answer": "```markdown The SOLID principles are a set of five design guidelines (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) that help developers create maintainable and flexible software. Their relationship to testability is significant:\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** By ensuring each class has one responsibility, classes become smaller and easier to test in isolation.\n- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Code that is open for extension but closed for modification allows new functionality to be added via new classes or methods, which can be tested independently.\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes can replace base types without altering correctness, making it easier to substitute mock or stub implementations during testing.\n- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Smaller, specific interfaces mean tests can focus on only the relevant behavior, reducing unnecessary dependencies.\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, dependencies can be easily replaced with mocks or fakes, facilitating unit testing.\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| SOLID Principle | How it Improves Testability                  |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| SRP             | Smaller, focused classes are easier to test |\n| OCP             | New features can be tested independently    |\n| LSP             | Substitutes (mocks/stubs) work seamlessly   |\n| ISP             | Tests target only necessary functionality   |\n| DIP             | Dependencies can be mocked or stubbed       |\n\n**In essence:**  \nApplying SOLID principles leads to loosely coupled, highly cohesive code, which is easier to isolate, mock, and verify in tests.

    "question": "How does the Open/Closed Principle facilitate plugin architectures?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** states that *software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification*. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.\n\n## How OCP Facilitates Plugin Architectures\n\nPlugin architectures are designed to allow new features (plugins) to be added to a system without altering its core codebase. The Open/Closed Principle is fundamental to this approach:\n\n### 1. **Core System is Closed for Modification**\n- The main application defines stable interfaces or abstract classes.\n- The core logic does not change when new plugins are added, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n\n### 2. **Plugins Extend Functionality**\n- New plugins implement the predefined interfaces or extend abstract classes.\n- The system can discover and load these plugins dynamically (e.g., via reflection, dependency injection, or configuration).\n\n### 3. **Decoupling via Abstraction**\n- OCP encourages programming to abstractions, not concrete implementations.\n- The core system interacts with plugins through interfaces, remaining agnostic to their specific behaviors.\n\n### 4. **Example**\n\n```csharp\n// Core system defines an interface\npublic interface IPlugin {\n    void Execute();\n}\n\n// Plugin implements the interface\npublic class MyPlugin : IPlugin {\n    public void Execute() {\n        // Plugin-specific logic\n    }\n}\n\n// Core system loads and uses plugins via the interface\nforeach (IPlugin plugin in pluginLoader.LoadAll()) {\n    plugin.Execute();\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Benefits**\n- **Extensibility:** New features can be added as plugins without touching the core code.\n- **Maintainability:** Core system remains stable and easier to test.\n- **Scalability:** Supports a growing ecosystem of plugins.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Open/Closed Principle enables plugin architectures by allowing the core system to remain unchanged (\"closed\") while supporting new functionality through extensions (\"open\"), typically via well-defined interfaces or abstractions. This separation is the foundation of robust, flexible plugin systems.",

    "question": "What are some common misconceptions about the SOLID principles?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### Common Misconceptions about the SOLID Principles\n\n1. **SOLID Must Be Applied Everywhere**\n   - Many believe every piece of code must strictly follow all SOLID principles. In reality, over-applying SOLID can lead to unnecessary complexity, especially in small or simple projects.\n\n2. **SOLID Is Only for Object-Oriented Programming**\n   - While SOLID was formulated for OOP, its underlying ideas (like separation of concerns and modularity) can benefit other paradigms as well.\n\n3. **Each Principle Is Isolated**\n   - Some think each principle stands alone. In practice, the principles often overlap and influence each other. For example, applying the Open/Closed Principle may also require adherence to the Liskov Substitution Principle.\n\n4. **Following SOLID Guarantees Good Design**\n   - SOLID is a guideline, not a guarantee. Blindly following SOLID does not automatically result in maintainable or readable code; context and judgment are still required.\n\n5. **SOLID Means More Classes and Interfaces**\n   - A common misconception is that SOLID always leads to more abstractions, classes, or interfaces. While this can happen, the goal is to improve flexibility and maintainability, not to increase codebase size unnecessarily.\n\n6. **SOLID Is Only for Large Projects**\n   - Some developers think SOLID is only relevant for large-scale systems. However, the principles can be beneficial in smaller projects, though the extent of their application may vary.\n\n7. **Violating SOLID Is Always Bad**\n   - There are cases where breaking a SOLID principle is justified for simplicity, performance, or other practical reasons. The principles are guidelines, not strict rules.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nSOLID principles are powerful guidelines for designing maintainable and flexible software, but they should be applied thoughtfully and pragmatically, not dogmatically.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an example illustrating how applying SOLID principles improved a project:\n\n---\n\n## Example: Refactoring an E-commerce Order Processing System\n\n### **Background**\nAn e-commerce platform had a monolithic `OrderProcessor` class responsible for:\n- Validating orders\n- Calculating discounts\n- Processing payments\n- Sending notifications\n\nAs the business grew, adding new payment methods, discount rules, and notification channels became increasingly difficult and error-prone.\n\n---\n\n### **Problems Faced**\n- **Rigid code:** Any change in payment or notification logic required modifying the `OrderProcessor`.\n- **Difficult to test:** Unit testing was hard due to tightly coupled logic.\n- **High risk of bugs:** Changes in one area often broke others.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying SOLID Principles**\n\n#### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\nSplit `OrderProcessor` into smaller classes:\n- `OrderValidator`\n- `DiscountCalculator`\n- `PaymentProcessor`\n- `NotificationService`\n\nEach class had one responsibility, making them easier to maintain and test.\n\n#### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\nIntroduced interfaces for payment and notification:\n```csharp\npublic interface IPaymentMethod { void ProcessPayment(Order order); }\npublic interface INotificationChannel { void Send(Order order); }\n```\nNew payment methods or notification channels could be added without modifying existing code.\n\n#### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\nEnsured all payment and notification implementations could be used interchangeably via their interfaces.\n\n#### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\nCreated specific interfaces for different notification types (e.g., `IEmailNotification`, `ISmsNotification`), so classes only depended on what they used.\n\n#### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\nUsed dependency injection to provide implementations of payment and notification services to the `OrderProcessor`.\n\n---\n\n### **Results**\n\n- **Easier to add features:** New payment methods and notification channels were added with minimal changes.\n- **Improved testability:** Each class could be unit tested independently.\n- **Reduced bugs:** Isolated changes reduced the risk of breaking unrelated functionality.\n- **Faster development:** Developers could work on different features in parallel without merge conflicts.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy applying SOLID principles, the project became more maintainable, extensible, and robust, directly contributing to its success as the business scaled.",

It states that:\n\n> **Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**\n\n### How OCP Helps in Software Development\n\n- **Enhances Flexibility:** You can add new features or behaviors to existing code without changing the original source code. This is typically achieved through inheritance, interfaces, or composition.\n- **Reduces Risk of Bugs:** Since existing code is not modified, there is less chance of introducing new bugs into previously tested and working code.\n- **Improves Maintainability:** Code is easier to maintain and extend because new requirements can be implemented by adding new classes or methods, not by altering existing ones.\n- **Supports Reusability:** Components designed with OCP in mind are more reusable, as they are built to be extended in different contexts.\n\n### Example in C#\n\n```csharp\n// Without OCP: Modifying the class for every new shape\npublic class AreaCalculator\n{\n    public double CalculateArea(object shape)\n    {\n        if (shape is Rectangle)\n        {\n            // calculate rectangle area\n        }\n        else if (shape is Circle)\n        {\n            // calculate circle area\n        }\n        // Need to modify this method for every new shape!\n    }\n}\n\n// With OCP: Open for extension, closed for modification\npublic interface IShape\n{\n    double Area();\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : IShape\n{\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n    public double Area() => Width * Height;\n}\n\npublic class Circle : IShape\n{\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n    public double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n}\n\npublic class AreaCalculator\n{\n    public double CalculateArea(IShape shape) => shape.Area();\n}\n```\n\n**Now, to add a new shape, you just implement `IShape`—no need to modify `AreaCalculator`.**\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Open/Closed Principle makes your codebase more robust, adaptable, and easier to maintain by allowing you to extend behavior without altering existing, tested code.",

Details should depend on abstractions.\n\nIn C#, this usually means that classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes, not on concrete implementations. This makes your code more flexible, easier to maintain, and easier to test.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Abstraction\npublic interface IMessageSender\n{\n    void Send(string message);\n}\n\n// Low-level module\npublic class EmailSender : IMessageSender\n{\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        // Send email logic\n    }\n}\n\n// High-level module\npublic class Notification\n{\n    private readonly IMessageSender _messageSender;\n\n    public Notification(IMessageSender messageSender)\n    {\n        _messageSender = messageSender;\n    }\n\n    public void Notify(string message)\n    {\n        _messageSender.Send(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Both `Notification` (high-level) and `EmailSender` (low-level) depend on the `IMessageSender` abstraction.\n- This allows you to easily swap out `EmailSender` for another implementation (like `SmsSender`) without changing the `Notification` class.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Promotes loose coupling.\n- Makes code easier to test and extend.\n- Reduces dependencies on concrete implementations.",

    "answer": "```markdown Following SOLID principles greatly improves code maintainability in C# by:\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class has one responsibility, making it easier to understand, modify, and test. Changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect others.\n- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new features without changing existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses can be used in place of their base classes without breaking the application.

Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Implementing the Open/Closed Principle in C# Using Inheritance\n\nThe **Open/Closed Principle** (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.\n\n#### Using Inheritance to Implement OCP\n\nIn C#, you can achieve this by:\n\n1. **Defining a base class or interface** with virtual or abstract methods.\n2. **Extending the base class** to add new behaviors, rather than modifying the original class.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you have a system that calculates the area of different shapes:\n\n```csharp\n// Step 1: Define an abstract base class\npublic abstract class Shape\n{\n    public abstract double GetArea();\n}\n\n// Step 2: Extend the base class for new shapes\npublic class Rectangle : Shape\n{\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n\n    public override double GetArea()\n    {\n        return Width * Height;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Circle : Shape\n{\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n\n    public override double GetArea()\n    {\n        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n    }\n}\n\n// Step 3: Use the base type in your code\npublic class AreaCalculator\n{\n    public double TotalArea(IEnumerable<Shape> shapes)\n    {\n        double total = 0;\n        foreach (var shape in shapes)\n        {\n            total += shape.GetArea();\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### How This Follows OCP\n\n- **Closed for modification:** The `AreaCalculator` and `Shape` base class do not need to change when you add new shapes.\n- **Open for extension:** You can add new shapes (e.g., `Triangle`, `Ellipse`) by inheriting from `Shape` and implementing `GetArea()`.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy using inheritance and polymorphism, you can extend your system with new functionality (new shapes) without modifying existing, tested code, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.",

Then setting `Height` to 10 sets both to 10. The area becomes `10 * 10 = 100`, not `5 * 10 = 50`.\n\n#### Why This Violates LSP\n\nThe `Square` class changes the expected behavior of `Rectangle`. Code that works with `Rectangle` objects will not work correctly with `Square` objects, breaking the substitutability required by LSP.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nLSP is violated when a subclass alters the behavior expected from the base class, leading to incorrect or unexpected results when the subclass is used in place of the base class.",

Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### How SOLID Principles Help in Writing Unit Testable Code in C#\n\nThe **SOLID principles** are a set of five design guidelines that help developers create maintainable, flexible, and robust software. Applying these principles in C# (or any object-oriented language) leads to code that is easier to **unit test**. Here’s how each principle contributes:\n\n#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n- **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change.\n- **Testability Benefit:** Classes with a single responsibility are smaller and focused, making it easier to write targeted unit tests for their behavior.\n\n#### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n- **Definition:** Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n- **Testability Benefit:** By using abstractions (like interfaces), you can extend functionality without changing existing code, reducing the risk of breaking tests and making it easier to mock dependencies in tests.\n\n#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n- **Definition:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n- **Testability Benefit:** Ensures that derived classes can be used in place of base classes without altering the correctness of the program, allowing for reliable polymorphic unit tests.\n\n#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n- **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n- **Testability Benefit:** Smaller, focused interfaces make it easier to create mock implementations for unit testing, and tests can focus on specific behaviors.\n\n#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n- **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n- **Testability Benefit:** By depending on abstractions (interfaces), you can inject mock or stub dependencies during testing, isolating the unit under test from external systems.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nApplying SOLID principles leads to loosely coupled, highly cohesive, and modular code. This structure makes it easier to write unit tests, as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed, classes are focused and small, and changes in one part of the codebase are less likely to break tests elsewhere.\n\n**Example:**  \n```csharp\npublic interface IEmailService\n{\n    void SendEmail(string to, string subject, string body);\n}\n\npublic class Notification\n{\n    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;\n\n    public Notification(IEmailService emailService)\n    {\n        _emailService = emailService;\n    }\n\n    public void Notify(string user)\n    {\n        _emailService.SendEmail(user, \"Hello\", \"Welcome!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n*Here, `Notification` depends on the abstraction `IEmailService`, making it easy to inject a mock email service during unit testing.*\n\n---",

This often means avoiding overriding methods in a way that changes expected behavior, removing unnecessary inheritance, or using interfaces instead.\n\n**Example of LSP Violation:**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Bird\n{\n    public virtual void Fly()\n    {\n        // Fly logic\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Ostrich : Bird\n{\n    public override void Fly()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Ostriches can't fly!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUsing `Ostrich` where a `Bird` is expected will cause runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n**Refactored Solution:**\n\n1. **Extract Interfaces Based on Behavior:**\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IBird\n{\n    void Eat();\n}\n\npublic interface IFlyingBird : IBird\n{\n    void Fly();\n}\n\npublic class Sparrow : IFlyingBird\n{\n    public void Eat() { /* ... */ }\n    public void Fly() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class Ostrich : IBird\n{\n    public void Eat() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n2. **Use Composition or Separate Hierarchies:**\n\nNow, only birds that can fly implement `IFlyingBird`. `Ostrich` does not have a `Fly` method, so substituting it where a flying bird is expected is not possible, thus preserving LSP.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Before (Violation)      | After (LSP Compliant)         |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Base class with `Fly()` | Separate interfaces/classes   |\n| Subclass throws error   | Only flying birds implement `Fly()` |\n\n---\n\n**Key Steps to Refactor:**\n\n- Identify where subclass behavior diverges from base class expectations.\n- Use interfaces or composition to separate behaviors.\n- Ensure all subclasses fulfill the contract of the base class.\n\nBy refactoring in this way, you maintain substitutability and adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle.",

    "question": "How does the Single Responsibility Principle relate to the concept of cohesion?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job. This principle is closely related to the concept of **cohesion** in software design.\n\n**Cohesion** refers to how closely the operations (methods) and data within a class are related to each other. A highly cohesive class has methods and data that are all focused on a single task or responsibility.\n\n### Relationship between SRP and Cohesion\n\n- **SRP promotes high cohesion:** By ensuring that a class has only one responsibility, all its methods and data are focused on that responsibility, which naturally increases cohesion.\n- **Low cohesion indicates SRP violation:** If a class has low cohesion (its methods and data are unrelated or serve multiple purposes), it likely violates SRP because it has more than one reason to change.\n- **Example:**\n\n    ```csharp\n    // Violates SRP and has low cohesion\n    public class Report\n    {\n        public string Content { get; set; }\n        public void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n        public void SaveToFile() { /* ... */ }\n        public void SendEmail() { /* ... */ }\n    }\n\n    // Follows SRP and has high cohesion\n    public class ReportGenerator\n    {\n        public string Generate() { /* ... */ }\n    }\n\n    public class ReportSaver\n    {\n        public void Save(string report) { /* ... */ }\n    }\n\n    public class EmailSender\n    {\n        public void Send(string report) { /* ... */ }\n    }\n    ```\n\nIn summary, **adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle leads to classes with high cohesion**, making your code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.",

    "question": "What is the role of abstraction in the Open/Closed Principle?",
    "answer": "```markdown Abstraction plays a crucial role in the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) of SOLID in C#. The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.\n\n### Role of Abstraction in OCP\n\n- **Defines Contracts:** Abstraction, typically through interfaces or abstract classes, defines contracts that concrete implementations must follow.\n- **Decouples Code:** By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, your code becomes less tightly coupled and more flexible.\n- **Enables Extension:** New behavior can be introduced by creating new classes that implement the abstraction, rather than modifying existing code.\n- **Prevents Modification:** Since existing code relies on abstractions, you don't need to change it when adding new features—just extend the abstraction.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Abstraction\npublic interface IShape\n{\n    double Area();\n}\n\n// Existing implementation\npublic class Circle : IShape\n{\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n    public double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n}\n\n// New extension, no modification to existing code\npublic class Rectangle : IShape\n{\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n    public double Area() => Width * Height;\n}\n\n// Client code depends on abstraction\npublic class AreaCalculator\n{\n    public double TotalArea(IEnumerable<IShape> shapes)\n    {\n        return shapes.Sum(shape => shape.Area());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `AreaCalculator` works with the `IShape` abstraction. To add new shapes, you simply implement `IShape` without changing `AreaCalculator` or existing shape classes.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nAbstraction enables the Open/Closed Principle by allowing systems to be extended through new implementations, rather than by modifying existing code, thus making the codebase more robust and maintainable.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Using Composition Over Inheritance to Adhere to SOLID Principles in C#\n\n**Composition over inheritance** is a design principle that encourages building classes by combining simple, reusable components (composition), rather than relying on class hierarchies (inheritance). This approach helps adhere to several SOLID principles:\n\n#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n- By composing classes from smaller, focused components, each class has a single responsibility.\n- Example: Instead of a `ReportPrinter` class that both formats and prints reports, you can have separate `IReportFormatter` and `IPrinter` interfaces, and compose them.\n\n#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n- Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.\n- With composition, you can add new behaviors by injecting new components, rather than modifying existing code.\n\n#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n- Composition avoids the pitfalls of improper inheritance hierarchies that can violate LSP.\n- Components can be replaced with others that implement the same interface.\n\n#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n- Composition encourages small, specific interfaces, so classes only depend on what they use.\n\n#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n- High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.\n\n---\n\n#### **Example in C#**\n\n```csharp\n// Define interfaces for behaviors\npublic interface ILogger\n{\n    void Log(string message);\n}\n\npublic interface IDataStore\n{\n    void Save(string data);\n}\n\n// Concrete implementations\npublic class FileLogger : ILogger\n{\n    public void Log(string message)\n    {\n        // Log to file\n    }\n}\n\npublic class DatabaseStore : IDataStore\n{\n    public void Save(string data)\n    {\n        // Save to database\n    }\n}\n\n// Composed class\npublic class ReportService\n{\n    private readonly ILogger _logger;\n    private readonly IDataStore _dataStore;\n\n    public ReportService(ILogger logger, IDataStore dataStore)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n        _dataStore = dataStore;\n    }\n\n    public void GenerateReport(string data)\n    {\n        _dataStore.Save(data);\n        _logger.Log(\"Report generated.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- `ReportService` can use any `ILogger` or `IDataStore` implementation.\n- New logging or storage mechanisms can be added without modifying `ReportService`.\n- Each class has a single responsibility and depends on abstractions.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nUsing composition over inheritance in C# helps you build flexible, maintainable systems that adhere to SOLID principles by favoring reusable components and abstractions over rigid class hierarchies.",

Here’s how it impacts API design:\n\n#### 1. **Promotes Fine-Grained Interfaces**\n- Instead of a single interface with many unrelated methods, ISP encourages splitting them into multiple, specific interfaces.\n- Example:\n\n    ```csharp\n    // Violates ISP\n    public interface IWorker\n    {\n        void Work();\n        void Eat();\n    }\n\n    // Adheres to ISP\n    public interface IWorkable\n    {\n        void Work();\n    }\n\n    public interface IEatable\n    {\n        void Eat();\n    }\n    ```\n\n#### 2. **Reduces Unused Method Implementations**\n- Clients only implement the methods they actually need, avoiding empty or meaningless method bodies.\n\n#### 3. **Enhances Maintainability and Flexibility**\n- Changes to one interface do not affect clients that do not depend on it.\n- Easier to extend APIs without breaking existing code.\n\n#### 4. **Improves Testability**\n- Smaller interfaces are easier to mock and test in isolation.\n\n#### 5. **Encourages Clearer Contracts**\n- Each interface represents a clear, single responsibility, making the API easier to understand and use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Without ISP               | With ISP                        |\n|-------------------------- |---------------------------------|\n| Large, \"fat\" interfaces   | Small, focused interfaces       |\n| Unused methods for clients| Only relevant methods exposed   |\n| Harder to maintain        | Easier to extend and maintain   |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nApplying the Interface Segregation Principle in C# API design leads to more modular, maintainable, and user-friendly APIs by ensuring that clients only depend on the functionality they actually use.",

    "answer": "```markdown To identify a violation of the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** in a C# codebase, look for interfaces that are \"fat\"—that is, interfaces that force implementing classes to define methods they do not need or use. The ISP states that \"clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\"\n\n### Signs of ISP Violation\n\n- **Large Interfaces:** Interfaces with many unrelated methods.\n- **Empty Implementations:** Classes implementing an interface with methods that have empty bodies or throw `NotImplementedException`.\n- **Unrelated Responsibilities:** Interfaces that group together methods that serve different purposes or functionalities.\n\n### Example of ISP Violation\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IWorker\n{\n    void Work();\n    void Eat();\n}\n\npublic class Robot : IWorker\n{\n    public void Work()\n    {\n        // Robot working code\n    }\n\n    public void Eat()\n    {\n        // Not applicable for robots\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Why is this a violation?**\n- `Robot` is forced to implement `Eat()`, which is irrelevant to its functionality.\n\n### How to Identify in a Codebase\n\n1. **Search for Large Interfaces:** Review interfaces with many methods.\n2. **Check Implementations:** Look for classes that implement interfaces and have methods with:\n   - Empty bodies\n   - `throw new NotImplementedException();`\n   - Comments like `// Not needed` or `// Not applicable`\n3. **Analyze Interface Responsibilities:** Ensure each interface has a single, well-defined purpose.\n\n### Refactoring Example\n\nSplit the interface into smaller, more specific interfaces:\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IWorkable\n{\n    void Work();\n}\n\npublic interface IFeedable\n{\n    void Eat();\n}\n\npublic class Robot : IWorkable\n{\n    public void Work()\n    {\n        // Robot working code\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Human : IWorkable, IFeedable\n{\n    public void Work()\n    {\n        // Human working code\n    }\n\n    public void Eat()\n    {\n        // Human eating code\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nA violation of the Interface Segregation Principle in C# is evident when classes are forced to implement methods they do not use, often resulting in empty or exception-throwing method bodies.

    "question": "How can SOLID principles be applied in combination with design patterns in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Applying SOLID Principles in Combination with Design Patterns in C#\n\nThe **SOLID principles**—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—are foundational guidelines for designing maintainable and scalable object-oriented systems. **Design patterns** are proven solutions to common design problems. In C#, SOLID principles and design patterns often complement each other, leading to robust and flexible codebases.\n\n#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) & Patterns\n\n**SRP** states that a class should have only one reason to change. Patterns like **Facade** and **Adapter** help enforce SRP by encapsulating complex subsystems or adapting interfaces, ensuring classes focus on a single responsibility.\n\n```csharp\n// Facade pattern example\npublic class OrderProcessor\n{\n    private readonly PaymentService _paymentService;\n    private readonly InventoryService _inventoryService;\n\n    public OrderProcessor(PaymentService payment, InventoryService inventory)\n    {\n        _paymentService = payment;\n        _inventoryService = inventory;\n    }\n\n    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)\n    {\n        _inventoryService.Reserve(order);\n        _paymentService.Charge(order);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) & Patterns\n\n**OCP** advocates that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. The **Strategy** and **Decorator** patterns are commonly used to achieve this in C#.\n\n```csharp\n// Strategy pattern example\npublic interface IDiscountStrategy\n{\n    decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal total);\n}\n\npublic class NoDiscount : IDiscountStrategy\n{\n    public decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal total) => total;\n}\n\npublic class SeasonalDiscount : IDiscountStrategy\n{\n    public decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal total) => total * 0.9m;\n}\n\npublic class ShoppingCart\n{\n    private readonly IDiscountStrategy _discountStrategy;\n\n    public ShoppingCart(IDiscountStrategy discountStrategy)\n    {\n        _discountStrategy = discountStrategy;\n    }\n\n    public decimal CalculateTotal(decimal total)\n    {\n        return _discountStrategy.ApplyDiscount(total);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) & Patterns\n\n**LSP** ensures that derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without altering correctness. Patterns like **Template Method** and **Factory Method** help enforce LSP by relying on polymorphism.\n\n```csharp\n// Template Method pattern example\npublic abstract class ReportGenerator\n{\n    public void GenerateReport()\n    {\n        FetchData();\n        FormatReport();\n        PrintReport();\n    }\n\n    protected abstract void FetchData();\n    protected abstract void FormatReport();\n    protected abstract void PrintReport();\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) & Patterns\n\n**ISP** recommends using multiple specific interfaces rather than a single general-purpose one. The **Command** and **Observer** patterns often utilize small, focused interfaces.\n\n```csharp\n// Observer pattern example\npublic interface IObserver\n{\n    void Update();\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteObserver : IObserver\n{\n    public void Update()\n    {\n        // React to subject update\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) & Patterns\n\n**DIP** suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions. The **Dependency Injection** and **Abstract Factory** patterns are direct implementations of DIP.\n\n```csharp\n// Dependency Injection example\npublic class EmailService : INotificationService\n{\n    public void Send(string message) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class NotificationManager\n{\n    private readonly INotificationService _service;\n\n    public NotificationManager(INotificationService service)\n    {\n        _service = service;\n    }\n\n    public void Notify(string message)\n    {\n        _service.Send(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| SOLID Principle | Related Design Patterns        | Benefit in C#                        |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| SRP             | Facade, Adapter              | Focused, maintainable classes        |\n| OCP             | Strategy, Decorator          | Extensible behavior                  |\n| LSP             | Template Method, Factory     | Reliable inheritance                 |\n| ISP             | Command, Observer            | Decoupled, flexible interfaces       |\n| DIP             | Dependency Injection, Factory| Loosely coupled, testable code       |\n\n---\n\n**In practice**, combining SOLID principles with appropriate design patterns in C# leads to code that is easier to test, extend, and maintain, while also reducing the risk of bugs and technical debt.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Real-World Scenario: Refactoring an E-Commerce Order Processing System\n\n#### Background\n\nA C#-based e-commerce platform had a monolithic `OrderProcessor` class responsible for:\n\n- Validating orders\n- Calculating discounts\n- Processing payments\n- Sending notifications\n\nOver time, the class grew to thousands of lines, making it difficult to maintain, test, or extend (e.g., adding new payment methods or notification channels).\n\n#### Applying SOLID Principles\n\n**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  \nThe `OrderProcessor` was split into focused classes:\n\n- `OrderValidator`\n- `DiscountCalculator`\n- `PaymentService`\n- `NotificationService`\n\nEach class handled one responsibility, making them easier to test and modify independently.\n\n**2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  \nTo support new discount strategies or payment methods, interfaces like `IDiscountStrategy` and `IPaymentMethod` were introduced. New implementations could be added without modifying existing code.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IPaymentMethod\n{\n    void ProcessPayment(Order order);\n}\n```\n\n**3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  \nAll payment method classes (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`) inherited from `IPaymentMethod` and could be substituted without breaking the order processing logic.\n\n**4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  \nInstead of a large `IOrderService` interface, smaller, more specific interfaces were defined, such as `IOrderValidator` and `INotificationSender`, ensuring classes only implemented what they needed.\n\n**5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  \nHigh-level modules (like the main order processing workflow) depended on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes. Dependency Injection was used to provide implementations at runtime.\n\n```csharp\npublic class OrderProcessor\n{\n    private readonly IOrderValidator _validator;\n    private readonly IDiscountStrategy _discountStrategy;\n    private readonly IPaymentMethod _paymentMethod;\n    private readonly INotificationSender _notificationSender;\n\n    public OrderProcessor(\n        IOrderValidator validator,\n        IDiscountStrategy discountStrategy,\n        IPaymentMethod paymentMethod,\n        INotificationSender notificationSender)\n    {\n        _validator = validator;\n        _discountStrategy = discountStrategy;\n        _paymentMethod = paymentMethod;\n        _notificationSender = notificationSender;\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Outcome\n\n- **Maintainability:** Each class was smaller and easier to understand.\n- **Testability:** Unit tests could target individual components.\n- **Extensibility:** New payment methods or notification channels could be added with minimal changes.\n- **Reduced Bugs:** Clear separation of concerns reduced side effects and regression issues.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nApplying SOLID principles transformed a rigid, hard-to-maintain class into a flexible, robust, and scalable order processing system, demonstrating their real-world value in advanced C# application development.",

    "question": "How do SOLID principles interact with other principles like DRY and KISS?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### How SOLID Principles Interact with DRY and KISS in C#\n\nThe **SOLID principles** (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) are foundational guidelines for object-oriented design in C#. They aim to make software more maintainable, extensible, and robust. However, they do not exist in isolation. They often interact—and sometimes compete—with other important principles like **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid).\n\n#### 1. Complementary Nature\n\n- **DRY**: Encourages eliminating code duplication. SOLID, especially the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), aligns with DRY by promoting modular, reusable components. For example, refactoring duplicated logic into a single class or method supports both SRP and DRY.\n- **KISS**: Advocates for simplicity. SOLID principles, when applied judiciously, can help keep code simple by breaking down complex systems into manageable, understandable pieces.\n\n#### 2. Potential Tensions\n\n- **Over-Engineering**: Strict adherence to SOLID (e.g., creating too many small interfaces for ISP or excessive abstraction for DIP) can lead to unnecessary complexity, violating KISS.\n- **Premature Abstraction**: Trying to avoid duplication (DRY) too early may result in abstractions that are hard to understand or maintain, conflicting with KISS and sometimes with SOLID (e.g., violating SRP by combining unrelated responsibilities).\n\n#### 3. Achieving Balance\n\n- **Pragmatic Application**: Use SOLID to guide design, but always consider DRY and KISS to avoid over-complication. For instance, favor clear, understandable code over rigid adherence to every SOLID rule in trivial scenarios.\n- **Refactoring**: Start simple (KISS), and as duplication or complexity arises, refactor using SOLID and DRY principles.\n\n#### 4. Example\n\n```csharp\n// Violates SRP, DRY, and KISS\npublic class ReportManager\n{\n    public void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void SaveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }\n    public void SendEmail() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Improved using SOLID, DRY, and KISS\npublic interface IReportGenerator { void GenerateReport(); }\npublic interface IReportSaver { void SaveToDatabase(); }\npublic interface IReportSender { void SendEmail(); }\n\npublic class ReportGenerator : IReportGenerator { /* ... */ }\npublic class ReportSaver : IReportSaver { /* ... */ }\npublic class ReportSender : IReportSender { /* ... */ }\n```\n- **SRP**: Each class has a single responsibility.\n- **DRY**: Shared logic can be abstracted into base classes or helpers.\n- **KISS**: Each class is simple and focused.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nSOLID, DRY, and KISS are synergistic when balanced thoughtfully. SOLID provides structure, DRY reduces redundancy, and KISS ensures simplicity. The best C# designs use these principles together, adapting to the context and complexity of the problem at hand.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nStrictly following SOLID principles in every situation can lead to both benefits and drawbacks. Here are the main trade-offs to consider:\n\n---\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n- **Maintainability:** Code is easier to understand, modify, and extend.\n- **Testability:** Smaller, focused classes and interfaces are easier to unit test.\n- **Flexibility:** Code is more adaptable to changing requirements.\n- **Reusability:** Well-defined responsibilities and abstractions promote code reuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Trade-offs / Disadvantages**\n\n1. **Increased Complexity**\n   - Over-abstraction can lead to a proliferation of classes and interfaces, making the codebase harder to navigate.\n   - Simple problems may become over-engineered.\n\n2. **Development Overhead**\n   - More time is required to design and implement solutions that strictly adhere to SOLID.\n   - Initial development may be slower due to the need for careful planning and abstraction.\n\n3. **Performance Impact**\n   - Excessive use of interfaces and indirection can introduce performance overhead, especially in high-performance or resource-constrained environments.\n\n4. **Premature Abstraction**\n   - Applying SOLID principles too early can result in abstractions that are not needed, leading to unnecessary complexity (YAGNI: \"You Aren't Gonna Need It\").\n\n5. **Learning Curve**\n   - Teams unfamiliar with SOLID may struggle to understand or maintain code that is heavily abstracted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Principle | Benefit | Potential Drawback |\n|-----------|---------|-------------------|\n| SRP, OCP  | Easier to change code | More classes, harder to trace logic |\n| LSP, ISP  | Flexible, decoupled code | Interface explosion, harder to manage dependencies |\n| DIP       | Testable, modular code | More abstractions, possible performance hit |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile SOLID principles are powerful guidelines for writing robust and maintainable code, applying them dogmatically can result in unnecessary complexity and overhead. It's important to balance SOLID with pragmatism—apply the principles where they add clear value, and avoid over-engineering solutions for simple problems. Use judgment and consider the context, team experience, and project requirements when deciding how strictly to follow SOLID in C#.",

    "question": "How can you balance performance concerns with SOLID principles in high-performance C# applications?",
    "answer": "```markdown Balancing Performance Concerns with SOLID Principles in High-Performance C# Applications\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplying SOLID principles in C# leads to maintainable and extensible code, but high-performance scenarios sometimes demand trade-offs. Here’s how you can balance both:\n\n### 1. **Profile Before Optimizing**\n\n- **Premature optimization** can lead to unnecessary complexity. Use profiling tools (e.g., Visual Studio Profiler, dotTrace) to identify real bottlenecks before refactoring SOLID code for performance.\n\n### 2. **Selective Abstraction**\n\n- SOLID often introduces abstraction layers (interfaces, base classes). In performance-critical paths (e.g., tight loops, real-time processing), minimize indirection:\n  - Use concrete types or sealed classes where appropriate.\n  - Avoid unnecessary virtual/abstract calls in hot paths.\n\n```csharp\n// Instead of always using interfaces:\npublic sealed class FastProcessor // No interface for hot path\n{\n    public void Process() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Dependency Injection with Care**\n\n- Constructor or property injection can add overhead. For high-frequency object creation:\n  - Use object pooling (e.g., `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool`).\n  - Consider static dependencies or factories for hot objects.\n\n### 4. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Data Locality**\n\n- SRP can lead to many small classes, potentially impacting cache locality.\n  - Group related data and behavior in structs or classes when it improves performance (e.g., for value types in arrays).\n\n```csharp\n// Structs for better data locality in performance-critical code\npublic struct Particle\n{\n    public float X, Y, Z;\n    public float Velocity;\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and Inlining**\n\n- Virtual methods can’t be inlined by the JIT, affecting performance.\n  - Use sealed classes and methods where possible.\n  - For plug-in architectures, keep OCP at a higher level, but use concrete implementations in hot spots.\n\n### 6. **Interface Segregation and Allocation**\n\n- Avoid excessive interface usage in performance-critical code to reduce allocations and indirection.\n- Use structs for small, immutable data and interfaces for less-frequent operations.\n\n### 7. **Liskov Substitution and Value Types**\n\n- Favor composition over inheritance for value types to avoid boxing/unboxing and maintain LSP.\n\n### 8. **Document and Justify Deviations**\n\n- When breaking SOLID for performance, document the reason and scope. Use comments and code reviews to ensure deviations are justified and localized.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| SOLID Principle | Performance Concern           | Balancing Approach                                   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| SRP             | Too many small classes       | Group for data locality in hot paths                 |\n| OCP             | Virtual call overhead        | Use sealed/concrete types in performance-critical code|\n| LSP             | Boxing/unboxing with structs | Prefer composition for value types                   |\n| ISP             | Interface indirection        | Limit interface use in hot paths                     |\n| DIP             | DI overhead                  | Use pooling/factories for frequent instantiation     |\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nApply SOLID principles by default, but profile and optimize only where necessary. Localize performance-oriented deviations, and always document your reasoning for future maintainability.",

    "question": "How do SOLID principles facilitate refactoring and code evolution?",
    "answer": "```markdown The SOLID principles—**Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation,** and **Dependency Inversion**—are foundational guidelines in object-oriented design that greatly facilitate refactoring and code evolution in C#. Here’s how each principle contributes:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n\n- **Facilitates Refactoring:** By ensuring each class has one responsibility, changes are localized. Refactoring a class for a new requirement is less risky, as unrelated functionality is not affected.\n- **Eases Evolution:** New features can be added by introducing new classes rather than modifying existing ones, reducing the chance of introducing bugs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n\n- **Facilitates Refactoring:** Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. When requirements change, you can add new behavior via inheritance or composition instead of altering existing code.\n- **Eases Evolution:** This minimizes regression bugs and makes the system more robust to change.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n\n- **Facilitates Refactoring:** Ensures that derived classes can substitute their base classes without altering the correctness of the program. This allows you to refactor hierarchies confidently.\n- **Eases Evolution:** You can introduce new subclasses or refactor existing ones without breaking client code.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n\n- **Facilitates Refactoring:** Encourages small, specific interfaces so that classes only implement what they need. This makes refactoring easier, as changes to one interface do not ripple through unrelated classes.\n- **Eases Evolution:** Adding new functionality often means adding a new interface, not changing existing ones, which prevents breaking changes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n\n- **Facilitates Refactoring:** High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions. This decouples components, making it easier to refactor implementations without affecting dependent code.\n- **Eases Evolution:** Swapping implementations (e.g., for testing or new features) is straightforward, supporting continuous evolution of the codebase.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Principle | Refactoring Benefit | Evolution Benefit |\n|-----------|---------------------|------------------|\n| SRP       | Localizes changes   | Easier feature addition |\n| OCP       | Extend without modify | Robust to change |\n| LSP       | Safe hierarchy changes | Add/modify subclasses safely |\n| ISP       | Isolated interface changes | Add features via new interfaces |\n| DIP       | Decouples components | Swap implementations easily |\n\n---\n\n## Example in C#\n\n```csharp\n// Before applying SOLID: tightly coupled, hard to refactor\npublic class ReportGenerator\n{\n    public void GeneratePdfReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void GenerateExcelReport() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// After applying SOLID: easy to extend and refactor\npublic interface IReportGenerator\n{\n    void GenerateReport();\n}\n\npublic class PdfReportGenerator : IReportGenerator\n{\n    public void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class ExcelReportGenerator : IReportGenerator\n{\n    public void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n**Result:** Adding a new report type or refactoring an existing one does not affect other report generators or client code.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**SOLID principles** promote loosely coupled, highly cohesive code. This structure makes refactoring safer and more manageable, and allows the codebase to evolve gracefully as requirements change.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### How Generics in C# Help Adhere to SOLID Principles\n\nGenerics in C# provide a powerful mechanism for creating reusable, type-safe code. Their use directly supports several SOLID principles:\n\n#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\nGenerics allow you to write classes and methods that operate on a variety of data types without duplicating code. This keeps each class focused on a single responsibility—its logic—rather than on handling multiple data types.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Repository<T>\n{\n    public void Add(T item) { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n*The `Repository<T>` class only manages repository logic, not type-specific details.*\n\n#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\nGeneric types are open for extension but closed for modification. You can extend functionality by specifying new type parameters without altering existing code.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Service<T>\n{\n    public void Process(T item) { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n*You can use `Service<Customer>` or `Service<Order>` without changing the `Service<T>` code.*\n\n#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\nGenerics promote substitutability by allowing code to operate on abstractions. For example, constraints (`where T : BaseClass`) ensure that generic methods/classes only accept types that fulfill certain contracts, maintaining behavioral substitutability.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Processor<T> where T : IProcessable\n{\n    public void Execute(T item) => item.Process();\n}\n```\n*Any `T` that implements `IProcessable` can be substituted without breaking the logic.*\n\n#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\nGenerics facilitate fine-grained interfaces. You can define interfaces with generic parameters, ensuring clients only implement what they need.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IRepository<T>\n{\n    void Add(T item);\n    T FindById(int id);\n}\n```\n*Clients can implement `IRepository<Customer>` or `IRepository<Product>` as needed.*\n\n#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\nGenerics enable high-level modules to depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. For example, services can depend on `IRepository<T>` rather than a specific repository class.\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomerService\n{\n    private readonly IRepository<Customer> _repository;\n    public CustomerService(IRepository<Customer> repository)\n    {\n        _repository = repository;\n    }\n}\n```\n*`CustomerService` depends on the abstraction `IRepository<Customer>`, not a concrete class.*\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nGenerics in C# promote code reuse, type safety, and abstraction, making it easier to design systems that adhere to the SOLID principles. They decouple logic from data types, encourage extensibility, and enforce contracts, all of which are foundational to robust, maintainable software architecture.",

    "question": "How can SOLID principles be applied to asynchronous programming in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nApplying SOLID Principles to Asynchronous Programming in C#\n===========================================================\n\nThe SOLID principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—are foundational to maintainable and scalable object-oriented design. When working with asynchronous programming in C#, these principles remain crucial for writing robust, testable, and flexible code. Here’s how each principle can be applied:\n\n---\n\n**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n\n*Each class or method should have one reason to change.*\n\n- **Application:**  \n  Keep asynchronous methods focused on a single task. For example, an async method should not handle both data retrieval and UI updates. Instead, separate concerns into different classes or methods.\n\n  ```csharp\n  public class DataFetcher\n  {\n      public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string url) { /* ... */ }\n  }\n\n  public class DataPresenter\n  {\n      public void PresentData(string data) { /* ... */ }\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n\n*Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.*\n\n- **Application:**  \n  Use abstractions (interfaces or base classes) for asynchronous operations. This allows you to extend functionality (e.g., adding logging or retry logic) without modifying existing async code.\n\n  ```csharp\n  public interface IDataFetcher\n  {\n      Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string url);\n  }\n\n  public class LoggingDataFetcher : IDataFetcher\n  {\n      private readonly IDataFetcher _inner;\n      public LoggingDataFetcher(IDataFetcher inner) { _inner = inner; }\n\n      public async Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string url)\n      {\n          Console.WriteLine(\"Fetching...\");\n          var result = await _inner.FetchDataAsync(url);\n          Console.WriteLine(\"Done.\");\n          return result;\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n\n*Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.*\n\n- **Application:**  \n  Ensure that asynchronous implementations of interfaces or base classes behave consistently. For example, always return a `Task` (never `null`), and ensure exceptions are handled in a way that does not break client code.\n\n  ```csharp\n  public class NullDataFetcher : IDataFetcher\n  {\n      public Task<string> FetchDataAsync(string url)\n      {\n          // Always returns a completed task\n          return Task.FromResult<string>(null);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n\n*Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.*\n\n- **Application:**  \n  Design small, focused async interfaces. For example, separate read and write operations into different interfaces.\n\n  ```csharp\n  public interface IDataReader\n  {\n      Task<string> ReadAsync(string id);\n  }\n\n  public interface IDataWriter\n  {\n      Task WriteAsync(string id, string data);\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n\n*Depend on abstractions, not concretions.*\n\n- **Application:**  \n  Inject dependencies (such as services or repositories) that expose asynchronous methods via interfaces. This enables mocking and testing of async code.\n\n  ```csharp\n  public class DataService\n  {\n      private readonly IDataFetcher _fetcher;\n      public DataService(IDataFetcher fetcher) { _fetcher = fetcher; }\n\n      public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)\n      {\n          return await _fetcher.FetchDataAsync(url);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Principle | Application in Async Programming |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|\n| SRP       | Separate async concerns         |\n| OCP       | Use abstractions for extension  |\n| LSP       | Consistent async behavior       |\n| ISP       | Small, focused async interfaces |\n| DIP       | Inject async abstractions       |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nApplying SOLID principles to asynchronous programming in C# leads to code that is easier to maintain, extend, and test. By designing with these principles in mind, you can avoid common pitfalls such as tightly coupled async logic, difficult-to-test code, and violation of separation of concerns.\n```",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## How SOLID Principles Relate to Microservices Architecture in C#\n\nThe **SOLID principles**—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—are foundational to object-oriented design in C#. When applied to microservices architecture, these principles help create scalable, maintainable, and robust distributed systems.\n\n### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n- **Microservices Context:** Each microservice should encapsulate a single business capability, aligning with SRP at the service level.\n- **C# Example:** A `UserService` handles only user-related operations, while an `OrderService` manages orders, ensuring clear separation of concerns.\n\n### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n- **Microservices Context:** Services should be open for extension (new features) but closed for modification (existing code remains stable).\n- **C# Example:** Use of interfaces and abstract classes allows adding new functionalities (e.g., new payment methods) without altering existing service logic.\n\n### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n- **Microservices Context:** Service contracts (e.g., APIs) should allow clients to substitute one implementation for another without breaking functionality.\n- **C# Example:** If a `NotificationService` interface is implemented by both `EmailNotificationService` and `SmsNotificationService`, clients can switch between them seamlessly.\n\n### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n- **Microservices Context:** Services should expose fine-grained, client-specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic APIs.\n- **C# Example:** Instead of a single `IUserService` with all user operations, split into `IUserRegistrationService`, `IUserProfileService`, etc., so clients depend only on what they use.\n\n### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n- **Microservices Context:** Services depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces, message contracts) rather than concrete implementations, promoting loose coupling.\n- **C# Example:** Use dependency injection frameworks (like ASP.NET Core’s built-in DI) to inject service dependencies, making it easier to swap implementations for testing or scaling.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| SOLID Principle | Microservices Impact | C# Implementation Example |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| SRP             | Service per business capability | Separate service classes/projects |\n| OCP             | Extend without modifying | Use interfaces/abstractions |\n| LSP             | Replaceable implementations | Polymorphic service contracts |\n| ISP             | Fine-grained APIs | Multiple small interfaces |\n| DIP             | Decoupled services | Dependency injection, abstractions |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nApplying SOLID principles in C# when designing microservices leads to services that are easier to develop, test, deploy, and maintain. Each principle supports the microservices philosophy of building small, independent, and loosely coupled components.",

    "question": "What challenges might you face when applying SOLID principles to legacy C# code?",
    "answer": "```markdown Applying SOLID principles to legacy C# code can be challenging due to several factors:\n\n### 1. **Tightly Coupled Code**\nLegacy codebases often have classes and modules that are highly interdependent, making it difficult to refactor without breaking existing functionality. Applying principles like the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) may require significant restructuring.\n\n### 2. **Lack of Unit Tests**\nMany legacy systems lack comprehensive unit tests. Refactoring code to adhere to SOLID principles without tests increases the risk of introducing bugs, as there’s no safety net to ensure existing behavior remains unchanged.\n\n### 3. **God Classes and Methods**\nLegacy code may contain large classes or methods that handle multiple responsibilities. Breaking these up to satisfy SRP or Open/Closed Principle (OCP) can be complex and time-consuming.\n\n### 4. **Inconsistent Naming and Structure**\nOver time, inconsistent naming conventions and architectural patterns may have crept in, making it harder to identify clear abstractions or interfaces needed for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and DIP.\n\n### 5. **Backward Compatibility**\nChanges required to implement SOLID principles might break backward compatibility with other parts of the system or with external clients relying on the current behavior.\n\n### 6. **Performance Concerns**\nIntroducing abstractions (e.g., interfaces, dependency injection) can sometimes have a performance impact, which may be unacceptable in performance-critical legacy systems.\n\n### 7. **Resistance to Change**\nTeams may be hesitant to refactor working legacy code due to fear of introducing defects, lack of time, or insufficient understanding of the codebase.\n\n### 8. **Technical Debt Accumulation**\nLegacy code often has accumulated technical debt, such as duplicated logic, lack of documentation, or outdated libraries, which complicates the application of SOLID principles.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nApplying SOLID principles to legacy C# code requires careful planning, incremental refactoring, and often the introduction of tests to ensure stability. The process can be resource-intensive but leads to more maintainable, flexible, and robust code in the long run.",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Using Dependency Injection Frameworks in C# to Implement the Dependency Inversion Principle\n\nThe **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states that:\n\n- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n\nIn C#, **Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks** such as Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, Autofac, or Ninject are commonly used to implement DIP by decoupling concrete implementations from their consumers.\n\n#### Example Scenario\n\nSuppose you have a service that sends notifications:\n\n```csharp\npublic interface INotificationService\n{\n    void Send(string message);\n}\n\npublic class EmailNotificationService : INotificationService\n{\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        // Send email logic\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA high-level class depends on the abstraction:\n\n```csharp\npublic class OrderProcessor\n{\n    private readonly INotificationService _notificationService;\n\n    public OrderProcessor(INotificationService notificationService)\n    {\n        _notificationService = notificationService;\n    }\n\n    public void ProcessOrder()\n    {\n        // Order processing logic\n        _notificationService.Send(\"Order processed!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Registering Dependencies with a DI Framework\n\nUsing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection:\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\n\nvar services = new ServiceCollection();\nservices.AddTransient<INotificationService, EmailNotificationService>();\nservices.AddTransient<OrderProcessor>();\n\nvar serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();\n```\n\n#### Resolving Dependencies\n\n```csharp\nvar orderProcessor = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<OrderProcessor>();\norderProcessor.ProcessOrder();\n```\n\n#### How This Implements DIP\n\n- **OrderProcessor** (high-level module) depends on the **INotificationService** abstraction, not a concrete implementation.\n- The concrete implementation (**EmailNotificationService**) is registered with the DI container.\n- The DI framework injects the correct implementation at runtime, allowing you to swap implementations (e.g., SMSNotificationService) without modifying the high-level module.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Loose coupling:** High-level modules are not tightly coupled to low-level modules.\n- **Testability:** You can easily substitute mock implementations for testing.\n- **Maintainability:** Changing implementations requires no changes to the dependent classes.\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Principle Aspect                | Implementation via DI Frameworks          |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Depend on abstractions          | Register interfaces, not concrete types   |\n| Invert control of dependencies  | DI container injects dependencies         |\n| Swap implementations easily     | Change registrations in DI configuration  |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nDependency injection frameworks in C# enable you to implement the Dependency Inversion Principle by ensuring that high-level modules depend on abstractions, and by managing the creation and injection of concrete implementations at runtime, thus promoting loose coupling and flexibility.",

    "question": "How does the violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle affect polymorphism in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown When the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is violated in C#, it undermines the reliability and correctness of polymorphic code. The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.\n\n### Effects of LSP Violation on Polymorphism\n\n- **Unexpected Behavior:** If a subclass does not honor the contract of its base class, substituting the subclass where the base class is expected can lead to incorrect or unpredictable behavior.\n- **Broken Client Code:** Code that relies on the base class's behavior may break or produce errors when a subclass that violates LSP is used.\n- **Loss of Interchangeability:** The main benefit of polymorphism—interchangeability of objects—is lost because subclasses cannot be safely used in place of their base class.\n- **Increased Maintenance Cost:** Debugging and maintaining code becomes harder, as assumptions about object behavior are no longer valid.\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\npublic class Rectangle\n{\n    public virtual int Width { get; set; }\n    public virtual int Height { get; set; }\n    public int Area() => Width * Height;\n}\n\npublic class Square : Rectangle\n{\n    public override int Width\n    {\n        set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }\n    }\n    public override int Height\n    {\n        set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Polymorphic usage:**\n\n```csharp\nRectangle rect = new Square();\nrect.Width = 5;\nrect.Height = 10;\nConsole.WriteLine(rect.Area()); // Expected: 50, Actual: 100\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe client expects that setting `Width` and `Height` independently will work as with `Rectangle`, but `Square` changes this behavior, violating LSP. This breaks the polymorphic contract and leads to incorrect results.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nViolating the Liskov Substitution Principle in C# breaks the core promise of polymorphism, making code unreliable and difficult to maintain. Subclasses must preserve the behavior expected by the base class to ensure safe and predictable polymorphic substitution.",

    "question": "How can SOLID principles help in designing extensible plugin-based architectures in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## How SOLID Principles Help in Designing Extensible Plugin-Based Architectures in C#\n\nThe **SOLID** principles are foundational to building robust, maintainable, and extensible software systems. In the context of plugin-based architectures in C#, these principles enable the seamless addition, removal, and modification of plugins without impacting the core application. Here’s how each principle contributes:\n\n### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n- **Definition:** Each class should have one, and only one, reason to change.\n- **Application:** In plugin architectures, the core system and each plugin should focus on a single responsibility. For example, the plugin loader is responsible only for discovering and loading plugins, while each plugin handles its own functionality.\n- **Benefit:** Changes in one plugin or the core system do not ripple across unrelated components, reducing the risk of bugs.\n\n### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n- **Definition:** Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n- **Application:** The core application defines interfaces or abstract classes (e.g., `IPlugin`), and plugins implement these interfaces. New plugins can be added without modifying the core system.\n- **Benefit:** The system can be extended with new plugins or features without altering existing, tested code.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IPlugin\n{\n    void Execute();\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n- **Definition:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n- **Application:** All plugins should be usable wherever the base plugin interface is expected. This ensures that the core system can interact with any plugin interchangeably, relying on the contract defined by the interface.\n- **Benefit:** Guarantees that new plugins won’t break the system’s expectations, enhancing reliability.\n\n### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n- **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n- **Application:** Define fine-grained interfaces for plugins. For example, if some plugins support configuration and others do not, use separate interfaces like `IConfigurablePlugin`.\n- **Benefit:** Plugins only implement the functionality they need, leading to cleaner and more focused code.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IConfigurablePlugin : IPlugin\n{\n    void Configure(IDictionary<string, object> settings);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n- **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n- **Application:** The core system depends on plugin abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations. Use Dependency Injection (DI) to inject plugin instances at runtime.\n- **Benefit:** Decouples the core system from plugin implementations, making it easy to add, remove, or swap plugins.\n\n```csharp\npublic class PluginManager\n{\n    private readonly IEnumerable<IPlugin> _plugins;\n    public PluginManager(IEnumerable<IPlugin> plugins)\n    {\n        _plugins = plugins;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| SOLID Principle | Role in Plugin Architecture          | Key Benefit                |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| SRP             | Separation of concerns              | Easier maintenance         |\n| OCP             | Use of interfaces/abstractions      | Extensibility              |\n| LSP             | Substitutable plugin implementations| Reliability                |\n| ISP             | Fine-grained plugin interfaces      | Focused, flexible plugins  |\n| DIP             | Dependency on abstractions          | Decoupling, testability    |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nApplying SOLID principles in C# plugin-based architectures ensures that the system is modular, extensible, and maintainable. It enables developers to add new plugins or modify existing ones with minimal risk and effort, fostering a scalable and robust ecosystem.",

    "answer": "```markdown To apply the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** when designing a C# library for public use, you should ensure that your interfaces are **specific, focused, and client-oriented**. The ISP states:\n\n> \"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\"\n\nHere’s how you can apply ISP in practice:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Design Small, Role-Specific Interfaces**\n\nAvoid large, \"fat\" interfaces. Instead, split them into smaller, more focused ones that group related functionality.\n\n```csharp\n// Bad: Fat interface\npublic interface IDocument\n{\n    void Print();\n    void Scan();\n    void Fax();\n}\n\n// Good: Segregated interfaces\npublic interface IPrintable\n{\n    void Print();\n}\n\npublic interface IScannable\n{\n    void Scan();\n}\n\npublic interface IFaxable\n{\n    void Fax();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Let Clients Implement Only What They Need**\n\nClients can now implement only the interfaces relevant to them, reducing unnecessary dependencies.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Printer : IPrintable\n{\n    public void Print() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class MultiFunctionPrinter : IPrintable, IScannable, IFaxable\n{\n    public void Print() { /* ... */ }\n    public void Scan() { /* ... */ }\n    public void Fax() { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**\n\nEncourage clients to compose functionality by implementing multiple small interfaces rather than inheriting from a large base interface.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Document Interface Contracts Clearly**\n\nProvide clear documentation for each interface, specifying its purpose and intended usage. This helps library users understand which interfaces to implement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Avoid Breaking Changes**\n\nIf you need to add new functionality, create a new interface rather than modifying existing ones. This maintains backward compatibility.\n\n```csharp\n// New functionality\npublic interface IEmailSendable\n{\n    void SendEmail();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Principle         | Application in Library Design                                  |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Small Interfaces  | Split large interfaces into focused, role-specific ones        |\n| Client-Oriented   | Let consumers implement only what they need                    |\n| Extensibility     | Add new interfaces for new features, avoid breaking changes    |\n| Documentation     | Clearly describe each interface’s purpose and usage            |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the Interface Segregation Principle, your C# library will be **easier to use, more maintainable, and less prone to breaking changes**. Clients will appreciate the flexibility and clarity provided by well-segregated interfaces.",

    "question": "How can you measure adherence to SOLID principles in a C# codebase?",
    "answer": "```markdown Measuring Adherence to SOLID Principles in a C# Codebase\n========================================================\n\nAdherence to SOLID principles—**Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion**—is crucial for maintainable and scalable C# code. While no tool can guarantee perfect adherence, you can use a combination of **static analysis**, **code reviews**, and **metrics** to assess how well your codebase follows SOLID principles.\n\n### 1. Static Code Analysis Tools\n\n- **SonarQube**: Analyzes code for maintainability, complexity, and design issues. It flags code smells and anti-patterns that often indicate SOLID violations.\n- **NDepend**: Provides advanced metrics and rules for C# projects, including:\n  - Class coupling (SRP, OCP)\n  - Method complexity (SRP)\n  - Interface usage (ISP)\n  - Dependency analysis (DIP)\n- **ReSharper**: Offers code inspections and suggestions that can highlight violations (e.g., large classes, tightly coupled code).\n\n### 2. Code Metrics\n\n- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: High complexity may indicate SRP violations.\n- **Class Coupling**: High coupling can violate OCP and DIP.\n- **Lines of Code per Class/Method**: Large classes/methods often violate SRP.\n- **Number of Interfaces Implemented**: Classes implementing too many interfaces may violate ISP.\n\nYou can use Visual Studio’s built-in **Code Metrics** tool or NDepend for these measurements.\n\n### 3. Code Reviews\n\n- **Manual Inspection**: Reviewers should look for:\n  - Classes with multiple responsibilities (SRP)\n  - Classes that require modification for new features (OCP)\n  - Inheritance hierarchies that break substitutability (LSP)\n  - Fat interfaces (ISP)\n  - Direct dependencies on concrete classes (DIP)\n- **Checklists**: Use SOLID-based checklists during reviews.\n\n### 4. Unit Testing\n\n- **Testability**: Code that is hard to test often violates DIP or SRP.\n- **Mocking**: Excessive mocking may indicate tight coupling.\n\n### 5. Example: Using NDepend\n\n```csharp\n// Example NDepend CQLinq query to find classes with high coupling\nfrom t in Application.Types\nwhere t.NbTypesUsed > 10\nselect t\n```\n\n### 6. Continuous Integration\n\n- Integrate static analysis and metrics tools into your CI pipeline to monitor adherence over time.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Principle | What to Measure/Look For                        | Tools/Methods                |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| SRP       | Class size, method complexity, responsibilities| Code metrics, code review    |\n| OCP       | Modifiability, use of abstractions             | Static analysis, code review |\n| LSP       | Inheritance correctness, substitutability      | Unit tests, code review      |\n| ISP       | Interface size, client usage                   | Code metrics, code review    |\n| DIP       | Dependency on abstractions vs. concretes       | Static analysis, code review |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMeasuring SOLID adherence is a combination of automated analysis, metrics, and human judgment. Use static analysis tools, code metrics, and rigorous code reviews to systematically evaluate and improve your C# codebase’s alignment with SOLID principles.",

    "question": "How do SOLID principles influence code review processes in C# projects?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nThe SOLID principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—play a crucial role in shaping code review processes in C# projects. Their influence can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Guiding Review Criteria**  \n   Reviewers use SOLID as a checklist to evaluate code quality:\n   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensures each class or method has one clear purpose, making code easier to understand and maintain.\n   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Encourages designs that allow extension without modifying existing code, reducing regression risks.\n   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Promotes correct inheritance hierarchies, ensuring derived classes can substitute base classes without altering program behavior.\n   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Discourages \"fat\" interfaces, leading to more focused and usable abstractions.\n   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Favors abstraction over concrete dependencies, enhancing testability and flexibility.\n\n2. **Improving Maintainability and Readability**  \n   Code adhering to SOLID is typically more modular and easier to reason about. During reviews, this means:\n   - Smaller, well-named classes and methods.\n   - Clear separation of concerns, reducing coupling.\n   - Easier identification of code smells and anti-patterns.\n\n3. **Facilitating Refactoring and Extension**  \n   SOLID-compliant code is easier to refactor and extend. Reviewers can more confidently approve changes, knowing the design supports future requirements with minimal risk.\n\n4. **Enhancing Testability**  \n   By promoting loose coupling (especially through DIP and ISP), SOLID principles make unit testing more straightforward. Reviewers check for dependency injection and mockable abstractions.\n\n5. **Reducing Technical Debt**  \n   Consistent application of SOLID helps prevent the accumulation of technical debt. Reviewers use these principles to flag potential long-term maintenance issues.\n\n**Example in C#:**\n\n```csharp\n// Violates SRP and DIP\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void SaveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Improved with SOLID\npublic interface IReportSaver {\n    void Save(string reportData);\n}\n\npublic class DatabaseReportSaver : IReportSaver {\n    public void Save(string reportData) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    private readonly IReportSaver _reportSaver;\n    public ReportGenerator(IReportSaver reportSaver) {\n        _reportSaver = reportSaver;\n    }\n    public void GenerateReport() { /* ... */ }\n    public void SaveReport(string data) {\n        _reportSaver.Save(data);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**In summary:**  \nSOLID principles provide a shared language and set of expectations for code quality in C# projects. They help reviewers systematically identify design flaws, encourage best practices, and ensure the codebase remains robust, maintainable, and scalable.\n```\n",

    "question": "Can you provide an example of refactoring a monolithic C# class into multiple classes following SOLID principles?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced example of refactoring a monolithic C# class into multiple classes following SOLID principles, with explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Original Monolithic Class\n\n```csharp\npublic class OrderProcessor\n{\n    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)\n    {\n        // Validate order\n        if (order.Total <= 0)\n            throw new Exception(\"Invalid order total.\");\n\n        // Save order to database\n        using (var db = new OrderDbContext())\n        {\n            db.Orders.Add(order);\n            db.SaveChanges();\n        }\n\n        // Send confirmation email\n        var smtpClient = new SmtpClient(\"smtp.example.com\");\n        smtpClient.Send(\"sales@example.com\", order.CustomerEmail, \"Order Confirmation\", \"Your order has been processed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Problems\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Handles validation, persistence, and email sending.\n- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Hard to extend for new validation or notification methods.\n- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Not relevant here, but would be if we tried to subclass.\n- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** No interfaces, so clients can't depend on what they need.\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depends on concrete classes (DbContext, SmtpClient).\n\n---\n\n## Refactored Using SOLID Principles\n\n### 1. Define Interfaces\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IOrderValidator\n{\n    void Validate(Order order);\n}\n\npublic interface IOrderRepository\n{\n    void Save(Order order);\n}\n\npublic interface INotificationService\n{\n    void Notify(Order order);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement Concrete Classes\n\n```csharp\npublic class OrderValidator : IOrderValidator\n{\n    public void Validate(Order order)\n    {\n        if (order.Total <= 0)\n            throw new Exception(\"Invalid order total.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class OrderRepository : IOrderRepository\n{\n    public void Save(Order order)\n    {\n        using (var db = new OrderDbContext())\n        {\n            db.Orders.Add(order);\n            db.SaveChanges();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EmailNotificationService : INotificationService\n{\n    public void Notify(Order order)\n    {\n        var smtpClient = new SmtpClient(\"smtp.example.com\");\n        smtpClient.Send(\"sales@example.com\", order.CustomerEmail, \"Order Confirmation\", \"Your order has been processed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Refactor the OrderProcessor\n\n```csharp\npublic class OrderProcessor\n{\n    private readonly IOrderValidator _validator;\n    private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;\n    private readonly INotificationService _notificationService;\n\n    public OrderProcessor(\n        IOrderValidator validator,\n        IOrderRepository repository,\n        INotificationService notificationService)\n    {\n        _validator = validator;\n        _repository = repository;\n        _notificationService = notificationService;\n    }\n\n    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)\n    {\n        _validator.Validate(order);\n        _repository.Save(order);\n        _notificationService.Notify(order);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **SRP:** Each class has one responsibility.\n- **OCP:** Add new validators, repositories, or notification methods without modifying existing code.\n- **LSP:** Can substitute implementations via interfaces.\n- **ISP:** Clients depend only on interfaces they use.\n- **DIP:** OrderProcessor depends on abstractions, not concrete classes.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nvar processor = new OrderProcessor(\n    new OrderValidator(),\n    new OrderRepository(),\n    new EmailNotificationService());\n\nprocessor.ProcessOrder(order);\n```\n\n---\n\nThis refactoring demonstrates how to break a monolithic class into SOLID-compliant, maintainable, and testable components in C#.",

    "question": "How do SOLID principles apply to the design of RESTful APIs in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## How SOLID Principles Apply to the Design of RESTful APIs in C#\n\nThe **SOLID** principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—are foundational to object-oriented design and are highly relevant when architecting RESTful APIs in C#. Here’s how each principle applies:\n\n### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n- **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change.\n- **Application in RESTful APIs:**\n  - Controllers should focus solely on handling HTTP requests and responses, delegating business logic to services.\n  - Example: Avoid placing data access or validation logic directly in controllers; instead, use separate service and repository layers.\n\n### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n- **Definition:** Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n- **Application in RESTful APIs:**\n  - Design controllers and services so that new features (e.g., new endpoints, validation rules) can be added via extension rather than modifying existing code.\n  - Use inheritance or composition to extend behaviors, such as custom filters or middleware.\n\n### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n- **Definition:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.\n- **Application in RESTful APIs:**\n  - Ensure that derived controller or service classes can replace base classes without breaking the API.\n  - For example, if you have a base `IRepository<T>`, any implementation should work seamlessly with the API logic.\n\n### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n- **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n- **Application in RESTful APIs:**\n  - Define small, focused interfaces for services and repositories.\n  - For example, instead of a large `IUserService` interface, split it into `IUserReader`, `IUserWriter`, etc., so controllers depend only on what they need.\n\n### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n- **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n- **Application in RESTful APIs:**\n  - Controllers and services should depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.\n  - Use Dependency Injection (built-in in ASP.NET Core) to inject dependencies, making the API more testable and maintainable.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Applying SOLID in a C# RESTful API\n\n```csharp\n// SRP: Controller delegates to service\npublic class OrdersController : ControllerBase\n{\n    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;\n    public OrdersController(IOrderService orderService)\n    {\n        _orderService = orderService;\n    }\n\n    [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]\n    public IActionResult GetOrder(int id)\n    {\n        var order = _orderService.GetOrderById(id);\n        if (order == null) return NotFound();\n        return Ok(order);\n    }\n}\n\n// ISP: Service interfaces are focused\npublic interface IOrderReader\n{\n    Order GetOrderById(int id);\n}\n\npublic interface IOrderWriter\n{\n    void CreateOrder(Order order);\n}\n\n// DIP: Service depends on abstractions\npublic class OrderService : IOrderReader, IOrderWriter\n{\n    private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;\n    public OrderService(IOrderRepository repository)\n    {\n        _repository = repository;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Principle | RESTful API Application Example                      |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| SRP       | Separate controllers, services, repositories        |\n| OCP       | Add new endpoints via extension, not modification   |\n| LSP       | Use substitutable service/repository implementations|\n| ISP       | Fine-grained interfaces for services/repositories   |\n| DIP       | Depend on abstractions, use Dependency Injection    |\n\n---\n\nBy adhering to SOLID principles, your C# RESTful APIs become more maintainable, testable, extensible, and robust.",
