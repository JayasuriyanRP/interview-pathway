    "question": "What are the best practices for implementing the Proxy pattern in distributed systems?",
    "answer": "```markdown **Best Practices for Implementing the Proxy Pattern in Distributed Systems (C#)**\n\nThe Proxy pattern is commonly used in distributed systems to control access to remote objects, add security, caching, or logging, and manage network communication. Here are best practices for implementing the Proxy pattern in C# within distributed environments:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Define Clear Interfaces**\n- Use interfaces or abstract classes for the subject (service) to ensure both the real object and the proxy implement the same contract.\n- Example:\n  ```csharp\n  public interface IService\n  {\n      Task<string> GetDataAsync(int id);\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Separation of Concerns**\n- Keep the proxy focused on cross-cutting concerns (e.g., security, caching, logging, network communication).\n- Avoid embedding business logic in the proxy.\n\n### 3. **Handle Network Failures Gracefully**\n- Implement robust error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms in the proxy to deal with network issues.\n- Example:\n  ```csharp\n  try\n  {\n      return await _realService.GetDataAsync(id);\n  }\n  catch (HttpRequestException ex)\n  {\n      // Log and handle error\n      throw new ServiceUnavailableException(\"Remote service is unavailable.\", ex);\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 4. **Support Asynchronous Operations**\n- Use async/await for network calls to avoid blocking threads and improve scalability.\n- Ensure all proxy methods are asynchronous where appropriate.\n\n### 5. **Implement Security Measures**\n- Add authentication and authorization checks in the proxy before forwarding requests.\n- Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, token validation).\n\n### 6. **Enable Caching When Appropriate**\n- Use caching in the proxy to reduce network calls for frequently requested data.\n- Ensure cache consistency and invalidation strategies are in place.\n\n### 7. **Logging and Monitoring**\n- Log requests, responses, and errors in the proxy for observability and troubleshooting.\n- Integrate with distributed tracing systems if possible.\n\n### 8. **Transparent Usage**\n- The proxy should be transparent to clients; clients should not need to know whether they are interacting with a proxy or the real object.\n\n### 9. **Resource Management**\n- Properly manage resources (e.g., HTTP connections, sockets) to avoid leaks.\n- Use dependency injection for managing the lifecycle of proxies and real objects.\n\n### 10. **Scalability and Performance**\n- Design proxies to be stateless where possible for easier scaling.\n- Minimize serialization/deserialization overhead for remote calls.\n\n---\n\n#### **Sample Proxy Implementation**\n\n```csharp\npublic class ServiceProxy : IService\n{\n    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;\n\n    public ServiceProxy(HttpClient httpClient)\n    {\n        _httpClient = httpClient;\n    }\n\n    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(int id)\n    {\n        // Example: Add authentication header\n        _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = \n            new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", \"your-token\");\n\n        // Example: Logging\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Requesting data for ID: {id}\");\n\n        // Network call with error handling\n        HttpResponseMessage response = await _httpClient.GetAsync($\"api/data/{id}\");\n        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\n\n        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Practice                      | Benefit                           |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Clear interfaces              | Decouples client and implementation |\n| Async operations              | Scalability, responsiveness       |\n| Error handling                | Robustness                        |\n| Security in proxy             | Protection against unauthorized access |\n| Caching                       | Performance improvement           |\n| Logging/monitoring            | Troubleshooting, observability    |\n| Resource management           | Prevents leaks, improves reliability |\n| Stateless design              | Easier scaling                    |\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Proxy Design Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#proxy)\n- [Martin Fowler: Remote Proxy](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/remoteFacade.html)\n\n---\n\nBy following these best practices, you can implement robust, maintainable, and scalable proxies in distributed C# systems.",

    "question": "How does the Flyweight pattern help with memory usage?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Flyweight pattern** helps with memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects instead of storing duplicate data in each object. In C#, this means that objects with similar or identical state can reference the same shared data (called the *intrinsic state*), while only storing unique information (the *extrinsic state*) separately.\n\n### How it Works\n\n- **Intrinsic State:** Shared, immutable data stored in flyweight objects.\n- **Extrinsic State:** Context-specific data stored or passed by the client.\n\nBy sharing intrinsic state, the Flyweight pattern reduces the number of objects created and the amount of memory used.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have a text editor displaying millions of characters. Instead of creating a separate object for each character, you can share character objects and only store their position separately.\n\n```csharp\n// The Flyweight\nclass Character\n{\n    private char symbol; // Intrinsic state\n\n    public Character(char symbol)\n    {\n        this.symbol = symbol;\n    }\n\n    public void Display(int position)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"{symbol} at position {position}\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Flyweight Factory\nclass CharacterFactory\n{\n    private Dictionary<char, Character> characters = new();\n\n    public Character GetCharacter(char symbol)\n    {\n        if (!characters.ContainsKey(symbol))\n            characters[symbol] = new Character(symbol);\n        return characters[symbol];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Reduced memory usage:** Shared objects mean less duplication.\n- **Improved performance:** Fewer objects to manage and garbage collect.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Flyweight pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects, making it ideal for applications with large numbers of similar objects.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nA real-world example of the Adapter pattern is using a power adapter to charge your laptop while traveling abroad. Different countries have different types of electrical outlets, but your laptop charger has a specific plug. The power adapter acts as an intermediary, allowing your charger (which expects a certain plug type) to connect to the foreign outlet (which provides a different plug type).\n\n**In C#:**\n\nSuppose you have a legacy printer class with a method PrintText(string text), but your new application expects objects with a Print(string content) method. You can create an adapter to bridge this difference:\n\n```csharp\n// Existing legacy class\npublic class LegacyPrinter\n{\n    public void PrintText(string text)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Printing: \" + text);\n    }\n}\n\n// Target interface expected by the new application\npublic interface IPrinter\n{\n    void Print(string content);\n}\n\n// Adapter class\npublic class PrinterAdapter : IPrinter\n{\n    private readonly LegacyPrinter _legacyPrinter;\n\n    public PrinterAdapter(LegacyPrinter legacyPrinter)\n    {\n        _legacyPrinter = legacyPrinter;\n    }\n\n    public void Print(string content)\n    {\n        _legacyPrinter.PrintText(content);\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        LegacyPrinter legacyPrinter = new LegacyPrinter();\n        IPrinter printer = new PrinterAdapter(legacyPrinter);\n\n        printer.Print(\"Hello, Adapter Pattern!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together, just like a power adapter lets your device connect to different types of outlets.",

    "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing the Adapter Pattern in C#\n\nThe **Adapter pattern** allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper that translates one interface into another.\n\n#### Example Scenario\n\nSuppose you have an existing class `OldPrinter` with a method `PrintOld(string text)`, but your application expects objects that implement the `INewPrinter` interface with a method `Print(string message)`.\n\n#### Step 1: Define the Target Interface\n\n```csharp\npublic interface INewPrinter\n{\n    void Print(string message);\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Existing Incompatible Class\n\n```csharp\npublic class OldPrinter\n{\n    public void PrintOld(string text)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Old Printer: \" + text);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Create the Adapter\n\n```csharp\npublic class PrinterAdapter : INewPrinter\n{\n    private readonly OldPrinter _oldPrinter;\n\n    public PrinterAdapter(OldPrinter oldPrinter)\n    {\n        _oldPrinter = oldPrinter;\n    }\n\n    public void Print(string message)\n    {\n        // Adapt the call to the old interface\n        _oldPrinter.PrintOld(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Usage\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        OldPrinter oldPrinter = new OldPrinter();\n        INewPrinter printer = new PrinterAdapter(oldPrinter);\n\n        printer.Print(\"Hello, Adapter Pattern!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Output\n\n```\nOld Printer: Hello, Adapter Pattern!\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Adapter pattern in C# is implemented by creating a new class (the adapter) that implements the expected interface and internally uses an instance of the incompatible class, translating method calls as needed.\n```\n",

    "question": "Explain the difference between object and class adapters.",
    "answer": "```markdown **Object Adapter vs. Class Adapter in C#**\n\nIn structural design patterns, particularly the Adapter pattern, there are two main ways to implement adapters: **object adapters** and **class adapters**.\n\n---\n\n### Object Adapter\n\n- **Implementation:** Uses composition. The adapter contains an instance of the class it adapts (the adaptee).\n- **How it works:** The adapter implements the target interface and internally calls methods on the adaptee object.\n- **Inheritance:** Relies on interfaces and object composition, not inheritance.\n- **Flexibility:** Can adapt the adaptee class and all its subclasses, since it works with objects.\n- **C# Support:** Preferred in C# because C# does not support multiple inheritance.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\n// Target interface\npublic interface ITarget\n{\n    void Request();\n}\n\n// Adaptee class\npublic class Adaptee\n{\n    public void SpecificRequest() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Object Adapter\npublic class ObjectAdapter : ITarget\n{\n    private readonly Adaptee _adaptee;\n\n    public ObjectAdapter(Adaptee adaptee)\n    {\n        _adaptee = adaptee;\n    }\n\n    public void Request()\n    {\n        _adaptee.SpecificRequest();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Class Adapter\n\n- **Implementation:** Uses inheritance. The adapter inherits from both the adaptee and the target interface.\n- **How it works:** The adapter overrides or implements the target interface methods and can directly access/adapt the adaptee’s methods.\n- **Inheritance:** Relies on multiple inheritance (inherit from both adaptee and target).\n- **Flexibility:** Can only adapt the specific adaptee class, not its subclasses.\n- **C# Support:** Not directly supported in C# because C# does not allow multiple inheritance of classes.\n\n**Example (Not possible in C#, but possible in languages like C++):**\n```csharp\n// C# does not support this directly\npublic class ClassAdapter : Adaptee, ITarget\n{\n    public void Request()\n    {\n        SpecificRequest();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Feature            | Object Adapter         | Class Adapter         |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| Implementation     | Composition           | Inheritance          |\n| Multiple Inheritance | Not required        | Required             |\n| Flexibility        | Can adapt subclasses  | Only adaptee class   |\n| C# Support         | Yes                   | No                   |\n\n---\n\n**In C#, object adapters are the standard approach due to the language's lack of multiple class inheritance.**",

    "question": "How does the Composite pattern simplify client code?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Composite pattern** simplifies client code by allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In C#, this is typically achieved by defining a common interface or abstract class for both simple (leaf) objects and complex (composite) objects. Here’s how it simplifies client code:\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Uniformity:** Clients interact with the interface, not worrying whether they're dealing with a single object or a group of objects.\n- **Recursive Structures:** Clients can work with tree-like structures (e.g., GUI components, file systems) without special-case logic.\n- **Simplified Code:** No need for type-checking or branching logic to distinguish between simple and composite objects.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Component interface\npublic interface IGraphic\n{\n    void Draw();\n}\n\n// Leaf\npublic class Circle : IGraphic\n{\n    public void Draw() => Console.WriteLine(\"Drawing a Circle\");\n}\n\n// Composite\npublic class GraphicGroup : IGraphic\n{\n    private List<IGraphic> _children = new List<IGraphic>();\n\n    public void Add(IGraphic graphic) => _children.Add(graphic);\n\n    public void Draw()\n    {\n        foreach (var child in _children)\n            child.Draw();\n    }\n}\n\n// Client code\nIGraphic drawing = new GraphicGroup();\ndrawing.Add(new Circle());\ndrawing.Add(new Circle());\ndrawing.Draw(); // Client doesn't care if it's a single Circle or a group\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Without Composite Pattern               | With Composite Pattern                |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Client must distinguish object types    | Client treats all objects the same    |\n| More conditional/type-checking code     | Cleaner, more maintainable code       |\n| Harder to extend and maintain           | Easy to add new components            |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Composite pattern abstracts the complexity of handling individual and grouped objects, letting client code remain simple, clean, and flexible.",

    "answer": "```markdown The **Facade pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. In C#, the Facade pattern can reduce system complexity in the following ways:\n\n### 1. **Simplifies Interactions**\nInstead of interacting directly with multiple classes in a subsystem, clients use a single Facade class. This reduces the number of dependencies and makes the code easier to use and understand.\n\n```csharp\n// Subsystem classes\nclass SubsystemA { public void OperationA() { /* ... */ } }\nclass SubsystemB { public void OperationB() { /* ... */ } }\n\n// Facade\nclass Facade\n{\n    private SubsystemA a = new SubsystemA();\n    private SubsystemB b = new SubsystemB();\n\n    public void SimpleOperation()\n    {\n        a.OperationA();\n        b.OperationB();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Hides Complexity**\nThe Facade encapsulates the intricate logic of the subsystem, exposing only what is necessary. This means clients are shielded from the internal workings and changes within the subsystem.\n\n### 3. **Promotes Loose Coupling**\nClients depend only on the Facade, not the subsystem classes. This reduces coupling and makes the system more maintainable and flexible.\n\n### 4. **Improves Maintainability**\nChanges in the subsystem can often be absorbed by the Facade, minimizing the impact on client code.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Facade pattern reduces system complexity by providing a unified, simple interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, hiding its complexities and promoting loose coupling between clients and the subsystem.",

    "answer": "```markdown The **Bridge pattern** is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.\n\n### Role of Abstraction\n\n- **Abstraction** defines the high-level control interface.

    "question": "What is a virtual proxy and how is it implemented in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown A **virtual proxy** is a structural design pattern that provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it. The virtual proxy is particularly useful for implementing lazy initialization—delaying the creation and loading of an expensive object until it is actually needed.\n\n## How Virtual Proxy Works\n\n- The proxy implements the same interface as the real object.\n- The proxy holds a reference to the real object, which is initially `null`.\n- When a method is called on the proxy, it checks if the real object exists. If not, it creates it.\n- The proxy then delegates the call to the real object.\n\n## Implementation in C#\n\nSuppose you have an interface `IImage` and a concrete class `RealImage` that loads an image from disk (an expensive operation). The proxy, `VirtualProxyImage`, will delay this loading until needed.\n\n```csharp\n// Subject\npublic interface IImage\n{\n    void Display();\n}\n\n// Real Subject\npublic class RealImage : IImage\n{\n    private string _filename;\n\n    public RealImage(string filename)\n    {\n        _filename = filename;\n        LoadFromDisk();\n    }\n\n    private void LoadFromDisk()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Loading image: {_filename}\");\n    }\n\n    public void Display()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Displaying image: {_filename}\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Virtual Proxy\npublic class VirtualProxyImage : IImage\n{\n    private string _filename;\n    private RealImage _realImage;\n\n    public VirtualProxyImage(string filename)\n    {\n        _filename = filename;\n    }\n\n    public void Display()\n    {\n        if (_realImage == null)\n        {\n            _realImage = new RealImage(_filename);\n        }\n        _realImage.Display();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        IImage image = new VirtualProxyImage(\"photo.jpg\");\n        // Image is not loaded yet\n\n        // Image will be loaded and displayed now\n        image.Display();\n\n        // Image is already loaded, just display\n        image.Display();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nLoading image: photo.jpg\nDisplaying image: photo.jpg\nDisplaying image: photo.jpg\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Virtual proxy** controls access to an object that is expensive to create.\n- It implements the same interface as the real object.\n- It instantiates the real object only when it is actually needed (lazy initialization).\n- Useful for optimizing performance and resource usage in C# applications.",

    "question": "How can the Flyweight pattern be used to optimize a graphics application?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Flyweight pattern** is a structural design pattern that helps reduce memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. In a graphics application, this pattern is particularly useful when you need to render a large number of similar objects (e.g., shapes, characters, tiles) that share common properties.\n\n## How the Flyweight Pattern Optimizes a Graphics Application\n\n### 1. **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State**\n- **Intrinsic State:** Shared, immutable data (e.g., shape geometry, color).\n- **Extrinsic State:** Context-specific, mutable data (e.g., position, current state).\n\nBy separating these states, the application can share the intrinsic state among many objects, reducing memory consumption.\n\n### 2. **Implementation Example**\n\nSuppose you are rendering thousands of trees in a forest. Each tree can share the same model and texture (intrinsic), but has its own position and size (extrinsic).\n\n```csharp\n// The Flyweight class\npublic class TreeType\n{\n    public string Name { get; }\n    public string Color { get; }\n    public string Texture { get; }\n\n    public TreeType(string name, string color, string texture)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n        Color = color;\n        Texture = texture;\n    }\n\n    public void Draw(Graphics g, int x, int y)\n    {\n        // Draw the tree at (x, y) using shared data\n    }\n}\n\n// The Flyweight Factory\npublic class TreeFactory\n{\n    private Dictionary<string, TreeType> _treeTypes = new();\n\n    public TreeType GetTreeType(string name, string color, string texture)\n    {\n        string key = $\"{name}_{color}_{texture}\";\n        if (!_treeTypes.ContainsKey(key))\n        {\n            _treeTypes[key] = new TreeType(name, color, texture);\n        }\n        return _treeTypes[key];\n    }\n}\n\n// The context class\npublic class Tree\n{\n    private int _x, _y;\n    private TreeType _type;\n\n    public Tree(int x, int y, TreeType type)\n    {\n        _x = x;\n        _y = y;\n        _type = type;\n    }\n\n    public void Draw(Graphics g)\n    {\n        _type.Draw(g, _x, _y);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Benefits**\n- **Reduced Memory Usage:** Only one instance of each unique `TreeType` is created and shared.\n- **Performance:** Less memory allocation and garbage collection overhead.\n- **Scalability:** Efficiently manage and render thousands or millions of objects.\n\n### 4. **When to Use**\n- When many objects share a significant amount of state.\n- When memory usage is a concern due to object count.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Flyweight pattern optimizes a graphics application by sharing common data (intrinsic state) among many objects, drastically reducing memory usage and improving performance, especially when rendering large numbers of similar graphical elements.",

    "question": "Explain how the Bridge pattern supports open/closed principle.",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Bridge pattern** is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This separation is achieved by defining two separate class hierarchies: one for the abstraction and another for the implementation.\n\n### How Bridge Pattern Supports the Open/Closed Principle\n\nThe **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**. The Bridge pattern supports OCP in the following ways:\n\n#### 1. Decoupling Abstraction and Implementation\n\nBy separating the abstraction (interface) from its implementation, the Bridge pattern allows you to extend either side independently without modifying existing code.\n\n```csharp\n// Abstraction\nabstract class Shape\n{\n    protected IDrawingAPI drawingAPI;\n    protected Shape(IDrawingAPI drawingAPI)\n    {\n        this.drawingAPI = drawingAPI;\n    }\n    public abstract void Draw();\n}\n\n// Implementation interface\ninterface IDrawingAPI\n{\n    void DrawCircle(double x, double y, double radius);\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Easy Extension\n\n- **To extend functionality**: You can add new abstractions (e.g., new shapes) by subclassing `Shape` without changing the implementation classes.\n- **To extend implementation**: You can add new drawing APIs by implementing `IDrawingAPI` without altering the abstraction hierarchy.\n\n```csharp\n// New abstraction extension\nclass Rectangle : Shape\n{\n    public Rectangle(IDrawingAPI drawingAPI) : base(drawingAPI) { }\n    public override void Draw()\n    {\n        // Implementation-specific drawing\n    }\n}\n\n// New implementation extension\nclass OpenGLDrawingAPI : IDrawingAPI\n{\n    public void DrawCircle(double x, double y, double radius)\n    {\n        // OpenGL-specific drawing code\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. No Modification of Existing Code\n\nWhen you introduce new shapes or drawing APIs, you **do not modify** the existing codebase—only extend it. This aligns perfectly with the open/closed principle.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                | Without Bridge Pattern | With Bridge Pattern      |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Adding new abstraction| May require changes   | Only extension needed   |\n| Adding new implementation| May require changes| Only extension needed   |\n| OCP Compliance        | Often violated        | Fully supported         |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe Bridge pattern supports the open/closed principle by enabling you to add new abstractions and implementations independently, **without modifying existing code**. This promotes maintainability, scalability, and flexibility in your C# applications.",

For example, a `Leaf` might have meaningless `Add()` or `Remove()` methods, leading to runtime errors or the need for empty implementations.\n\n2. **Complexity in Type Safety**  \n   The uniform interface may force clients to perform type checks or casts if they need to distinguish between leaves and composites, which can reduce type safety and clarity.\n\n3. **Difficulties in Managing Child Components**  \n   Managing parent-child relationships (e.g., setting parent references, handling removal) can become complex, especially in mutable structures.\n\n4. **Performance Overhead**  \n   The recursive structure can lead to performance issues, especially with deep or large hierarchies, as operations may require traversing the entire tree.\n\n5. **Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle**  \n   Components may end up with responsibilities for both leaf and composite behaviors, making the code harder to maintain.\n\n6. **Increased Memory Usage**  \n   Each node (even leaves) may carry references or data structures (like child lists) that are unnecessary for their role, leading to wasted memory.\n\n7. **Difficulties in Adding New Component Types**  \n   Adding new types of components can require changes to the base component interface, potentially breaking existing code.\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Pitfall                              | Description                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overgeneralization                    | Uniform interface may expose meaningless operations on leaves               |\n| Type Safety Complexity                | May require type checks/casts, reducing clarity                             |\n| Child Management Complexity           | Parent-child relationships can be hard to manage                            |\n| Performance Overhead                  | Recursive operations can be costly on large/deep trees                      |\n| Single Responsibility Violation       | Components may have mixed responsibilities                                  |\n| Increased Memory Usage                | Unnecessary data structures in leaves/composites                            |\n| Difficulty Adding New Types           | Interface changes may break existing code                                   |\n\n**Best Practices:**  \n- Carefully design the component interface to minimize meaningless operations.\n- Consider using exceptions or default implementations for unsupported operations.\n- Use the pattern where the benefits of uniformity outweigh the drawbacks.\n\n**References:**  \n- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern)  \n- [Microsoft Docs: Composite Design Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#composite-pattern)",

    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced explanation of how you can **combine the Decorator and Composite patterns in C#**, with code examples.\n\n---\n\n## Combining Decorator and Composite Patterns in C#\n\nThe **Composite pattern** lets you treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The **Decorator pattern** allows you to add responsibilities to objects dynamically.\n\nBy combining them, you can create complex tree structures (Composite) where nodes can be dynamically decorated (Decorator) with additional behavior.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nSuppose you have a `Component` interface for UI elements. You want to build a tree of components (Composite), and also allow dynamic addition of features like borders or scrollbars (Decorator).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Define the Component Interface\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IComponent\n{\n    void Operation();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Implement Leaf and Composite\n\n```csharp\npublic class Leaf : IComponent\n{\n    public void Operation()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Leaf operation\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Composite : IComponent\n{\n    private readonly List<IComponent> _children = new List<IComponent>();\n\n    public void Add(IComponent component) => _children.Add(component);\n\n    public void Operation()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Composite operation\");\n        foreach (var child in _children)\n        {\n            child.Operation();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Decorator\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class ComponentDecorator : IComponent\n{\n    protected IComponent _component;\n\n    protected ComponentDecorator(IComponent component)\n    {\n        _component = component;\n    }\n\n    public virtual void Operation()\n    {\n        _component.Operation();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BorderDecorator : ComponentDecorator\n{\n    public BorderDecorator(IComponent component) : base(component) { }\n\n    public override void Operation()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Border added\");\n        base.Operation();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Combine Them\n\nYou can decorate both leaf and composite nodes, since both implement `IComponent`:\n\n```csharp\nvar leaf = new Leaf();\nvar decoratedLeaf = new BorderDecorator(leaf);\n\nvar composite = new Composite();\ncomposite.Add(decoratedLeaf);\ncomposite.Add(new Leaf());\n\nvar decoratedComposite = new BorderDecorator(composite);\n\ndecoratedComposite.Operation();\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nBorder added\nComposite operation\nBorder added\nLeaf operation\nLeaf operation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Both patterns rely on a common interface (`IComponent`).\n- Decorators can wrap both leaves and composites.\n- You can build a tree of components, then decorate any node (including the whole tree) with additional behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- UI frameworks (decorating widgets in a tree)\n- File system structures (decorating files/folders)\n- Game object hierarchies (adding behaviors dynamically)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nBy ensuring both patterns share the same interface, you can freely compose and decorate objects, enabling highly flexible and extensible designs in C#.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Static vs. Dynamic Proxies in C#**\n\nIn C#, proxies are used to control access to objects, add behavior, or intercept method calls. The main difference between static and dynamic proxies lies in how they are created and used:\n\n---\n\n### Static Proxies\n\n- **Definition:** Static proxies are classes that are explicitly written in code to wrap or delegate calls to another class (the \"real subject\").\n- **Creation:** The proxy class is manually coded at compile time.\n- **Type Safety:** Since the proxy is a concrete class, it is type-safe and checked at compile time.\n- **Flexibility:** Less flexible; any change in the interface or behavior requires modifying the proxy class.\n- **Performance:** Slightly better performance since there is no runtime code generation.\n- **Example:**\n\n    ```csharp\n    public interface IService\n    {\n        void DoWork();\n    }\n\n    public class RealService : IService\n    {\n        public void DoWork() { /* ... */ }\n    }\n\n    public class ServiceProxy : IService\n    {\n        private readonly RealService _realService = new RealService();\n\n        public void DoWork()\n        {\n            // Additional behavior\n            _realService.DoWork();\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### Dynamic Proxies\n\n- **Definition:** Dynamic proxies are generated at runtime, often using reflection or libraries (such as Castle DynamicProxy).\n- **Creation:** The proxy class is created dynamically, usually by intercepting method calls and delegating them as needed.\n- **Type Safety:** Type safety is ensured at runtime, not at compile time.\n- **Flexibility:** Highly flexible; can proxy any type or interface at runtime and can add behaviors dynamically (e.g., logging, security, transactions).\n- **Performance:** Slightly slower due to runtime overhead and reflection.\n- **Example (using Castle DynamicProxy):**\n\n    ```csharp\n    var proxyGenerator = new ProxyGenerator();\n    IService proxy = proxyGenerator.CreateInterfaceProxyWithTarget<IService>(\n        new RealService(),\n        new MyInterceptor()\n    );\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Feature         | Static Proxy                   | Dynamic Proxy                         |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Creation        | Compile-time (manual)          | Runtime (automatic)                   |\n| Flexibility     | Low                            | High                                  |\n| Type Safety     | Compile-time                   | Runtime                               |\n| Performance     | Slightly better                | Slightly slower (reflection overhead) |\n| Use Cases       | Simple, known scenarios        | AOP, logging, security, mocking       |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Use **static proxies** when the proxy logic is simple and unlikely to change.\n- Use **dynamic proxies** for advanced scenarios like aspect-oriented programming, where behaviors need to be injected at runtime.",

    "answer": "```markdown\nTo implement thread-safe Flyweight objects in C#, you need to ensure that:\n\n1. **Intrinsic state** (shared data) is immutable or accessed in a thread-safe manner.\n2. The **Flyweight Factory** manages the creation and sharing of flyweight instances safely across threads.\n\n### Steps to Implement Thread-Safe Flyweight\n\n#### 1. Make Intrinsic State Immutable\n\nFlyweight objects should not allow modification of their shared state after creation. Use `readonly` fields or properties.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Flyweight\n{\n    public string IntrinsicState { get; }\n\n    public Flyweight(string intrinsicState)\n    {\n        IntrinsicState = intrinsicState;\n    }\n\n    public void Operation(string extrinsicState)\n    {\n        // Use intrinsic and extrinsic state\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Use a Thread-Safe Factory\n\nUse `ConcurrentDictionary` to store and retrieve flyweight instances safely.\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Concurrent;\n\npublic class FlyweightFactory\n{\n    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, Flyweight> _flyweights = new();\n\n    public Flyweight GetFlyweight(string key)\n    {\n        return _flyweights.GetOrAdd(key, k => new Flyweight(k));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3.

    "question": "Can the Adapter pattern be used with interfaces only? Explain.",
    "answer": "```markdown No, the Adapter pattern in C# is not limited to interfaces only; it can be used with both interfaces and concrete classes.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Adapter pattern’s primary purpose is to allow incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface. In C#, there are two main ways to implement the Adapter pattern:\n\n1. **Object Adapter (using interfaces):**\n   - The adapter implements the target interface and holds a reference to an instance of the adaptee (the class being adapted).\n   - This is the most common approach in C#, leveraging interface inheritance and composition.\n   - Example:\n     ```csharp\n     public interface ITarget\n     {\n         void Request();\n     }\n\n     public class Adaptee\n     {\n         public void SpecificRequest() { /* ... */ }\n     }\n\n     public class Adapter : ITarget\n     {\n         private readonly Adaptee _adaptee;\n         public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) { _adaptee = adaptee; }\n         public void Request() { _adaptee.SpecificRequest(); }\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Class Adapter (using classes):**\n   - The adapter inherits from the adaptee class and implements the target interface.\n   - This approach requires multiple inheritance, which C# does not support for classes (only for interfaces). However, you can use this pattern if the adaptee is a class and the adapter needs to extend its functionality, but only if the adaptee is not sealed and you don’t need to inherit from another class.\n   - Example:\n     ```csharp\n     public class Adaptee\n     {\n         public void SpecificRequest() { /* ... */ }\n     }\n\n     public interface ITarget\n     {\n         void Request();\n     }\n\n     public class Adapter : Adaptee, ITarget\n     {\n         public void Request() { SpecificRequest(); }\n     }\n     ```\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Adapter Type     | Uses Interfaces? | Uses Classes? | C# Support |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------|------------|\n| Object Adapter   | Yes              | Yes           | Yes        |\n| Class Adapter    | Yes              | Yes           | Limited*   |\n\n\\*Limited because C# does not support multiple inheritance for classes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Adapter pattern in C# is not restricted to interfaces; it can be applied to classes as well. However, using interfaces is more flexible and idiomatic in C#, especially due to language constraints around inheritance.",

    "question": "How does the Facade pattern affect testability of a system?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Facade pattern** can have both positive and negative effects on the testability of a C# system:\n\n### Positive Effects\n\n- **Simplifies Testing of Client Code:**  \n  By providing a unified interface to a set of subsystems, the Facade pattern reduces the complexity of the interactions that client code needs to test. Test cases can focus on the Facade’s interface rather than the intricate details of the underlying subsystems.\n\n- **Enables Mocking and Stubbing:**  \n  The Facade itself can be easily mocked or stubbed in unit tests, allowing you to isolate and test client components without invoking the actual subsystems.\n\n- **Encourages Separation of Concerns:**  \n  By decoupling clients from subsystem implementations, the Facade pattern helps ensure that tests for client code are not tightly coupled to the details of subsystem classes.\n\n### Negative Effects\n\n- **Potentially Hides Subsystem Complexity:**  \n  If the Facade is too coarse-grained or does not expose enough control, it may make it difficult to test specific behaviors of the underlying subsystems, especially if those behaviors are not surfaced through the Facade.\n\n- **Over-reliance on Facade:**  \n  Tests that only interact with the Facade may miss edge cases or bugs present in the subsystems, leading to insufficient test coverage.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Expose Necessary Functionality:**  \n  Ensure the Facade exposes all necessary operations required for comprehensive testing, or provide ways to access subsystems for more granular tests.\n\n- **Use Dependency Injection:**  \n  Inject subsystems into the Facade, allowing for easier mocking and testing of both the Facade and its subsystems.\n\n- **Test Both Facade and Subsystems:**  \n  Write tests for the Facade interface as well as for the underlying subsystems to ensure full coverage.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Facade pattern generally improves testability by simplifying interfaces and decoupling clients from complex subsystems. However, care must be taken to avoid hiding important behaviors and to ensure that both the Facade and its subsystems are adequately tested.",

    "question": "How do you handle state in the Decorator pattern?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nIn the **Decorator pattern**, state management can be handled in several ways, depending on whether the state is intrinsic to the component or specific to the decorator.\n\n### 1. State in the Component\nIf the state is intrinsic to the component (i.e., it should be shared across all decorators), the state should be stored in the base component class. All decorators delegate state manipulation to the wrapped component.\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class Component\n{\n    public abstract int State { get; set; }\n    public abstract void Operation();\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteComponent : Component\n{\n    private int _state;\n    public override int State\n    {\n        get => _state;\n        set => _state = value;\n    }\n\n    public override void Operation()\n    {\n        // Use _state\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. State in the Decorator\nIf the state is specific to a particular decorator (i.e., only relevant to the added behavior), it should be stored in the decorator itself.\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class Decorator : Component\n{\n    protected Component _component;\n    public Decorator(Component component)\n    {\n        _component = component;\n    }\n\n    public override int State\n    {\n        get => _component.State;\n        set => _component.State = value;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteDecorator : Decorator\n{\n    private int _decoratorState;\n\n    public ConcreteDecorator(Component component) : base(component) { }\n\n    public override void Operation()\n    {\n        // Use _decoratorState for decorator-specific logic\n        _component.Operation();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Combining State\nSometimes, both the component and decorator need to maintain their own state. In this case, each class manages its own state, and the decorator can choose to expose or hide its state as needed.\n\n### **Key Points**\n- **Component state**: Store in the base component; decorators delegate state access.\n- **Decorator-specific state**: Store in the decorator; encapsulate or expose as needed.\n- **Thread safety**: If multiple decorators or threads are involved, ensure state is managed safely.\n- **Avoid state duplication**: Don’t duplicate state between component and decorators unless necessary.\n\n### **Example**\n```csharp\nvar component = new ConcreteComponent();\nvar decorated = new ConcreteDecorator(component);\n\ndecorated.State = 42; // Sets state in the base component\ndecorated.Operation(); // Uses both component and decorator state\n```\n\n**In summary:**  \nHandle shared state in the component, decorator-specific state in the decorator, and always delegate appropriately to avoid inconsistencies.\n```\n",

    "question": "Explain the role of the 'Component' interface in the Composite pattern.",
    "answer": "```markdown\nIn the Composite pattern, the **Component** interface plays a crucial role as the common abstraction for all objects in the composition—both individual objects (leaves) and groups of objects (composites). It defines the standard operations that can be performed on both simple and complex elements, enabling clients to treat all objects uniformly.\n\n### Key Roles of the `Component` Interface:\n\n- **Defines the Common Interface:**  \n  It declares the methods and properties that must be implemented by both leaf and composite classes. For example, methods like `Add()`, `Remove()`, or `Display()`.\n\n- **Enables Uniformity:**  \n  By programming to the `Component` interface, client code can interact with both individual objects and composites without knowing their concrete types.\n\n- **Supports Recursive Structures:**  \n  Since composites can contain other components (leaves or composites), the interface allows for recursive composition, forming tree-like structures.\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Component interface\npublic interface IComponent\n{\n    void Display(int depth);\n}\n```\n\nBoth `Leaf` and `Composite` classes implement this interface:\n\n```csharp\n// Leaf\npublic class Leaf : IComponent\n{\n    public void Display(int depth)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(new String('-', depth) + \" Leaf\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Composite\npublic class Composite : IComponent\n{\n    private List<IComponent> _children = new List<IComponent>();\n\n    public void Add(IComponent component)\n    {\n        _children.Add(component);\n    }\n\n    public void Display(int depth)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(new String('-', depth) + \" Composite\");\n        foreach (var child in _children)\n        {\n            child.Display(depth + 2);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `Component` interface is fundamental in the Composite pattern, as it allows both simple and complex elements to be treated uniformly, enabling flexible and scalable tree structures in C# applications.\n```",

    "question": "How can you use dependency injection with structural patterns in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## Using Dependency Injection with Structural Patterns in C#\n\nDependency Injection (DI) is a technique for achieving loose coupling and easier testability by providing dependencies from the outside rather than creating them internally. Structural patterns, such as Adapter, Facade, Decorator, Proxy, and Composite, focus on composing classes and objects to form larger structures.\n\n### How Dependency Injection Enhances Structural Patterns\n\nWhen implementing structural patterns in C#, DI can be leveraged to:\n\n- **Decouple pattern participants** (e.g., adapters, decorators, proxies) from their dependencies.\n- **Enable easy swapping of implementations** (e.g., for testing or changing behavior).\n- **Promote single responsibility and open/closed principles**.\n\n### Example: Decorator Pattern with Dependency Injection\n\nSuppose you have a service interface and want to add logging via a decorator.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IService\n{\n    void Execute();\n}\n\npublic class RealService : IService\n{\n    public void Execute() => Console.WriteLine(\"Executing service logic.\");\n}\n\npublic class LoggingDecorator : IService\n{\n    private readonly IService _inner;\n\n    public LoggingDecorator(IService inner)\n    {\n        _inner = inner;\n    }\n\n    public void Execute()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Logging before execution.\");\n        _inner.Execute();\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Logging after execution.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Registering with Dependency Injection (e.g., ASP.NET Core)\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddTransient<RealService>();\nservices.AddTransient<IService>(provider =>\n    new LoggingDecorator(provider.GetRequiredService<RealService>()));\n```\n\nOr, for chaining multiple decorators:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddTransient<IService, RealService>();\nservices.Decorate<IService, LoggingDecorator>();\n```\n*(Requires Scrutor or similar library for `Decorate` extension)*\n\n### Example: Adapter Pattern with Dependency Injection\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ITarget\n{\n    void Request();\n}\n\npublic class Adaptee\n{\n    public void SpecificRequest() => Console.WriteLine(\"Adaptee logic.\");\n}\n\npublic class Adapter : ITarget\n{\n    private readonly Adaptee _adaptee;\n\n    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee)\n    {\n        _adaptee = adaptee;\n    }\n\n    public void Request() => _adaptee.SpecificRequest();\n}\n```\n\n#### Registering with DI\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddTransient<Adaptee>();\nservices.AddTransient<ITarget, Adapter>();\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Inject dependencies** into pattern participants via constructors.\n- **Register pattern implementations** in the DI container.\n- **Swap or decorate implementations** easily for testing or extension.\n- **Structural patterns** become more flexible and testable with DI.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Dependency injection in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)\n- [Scrutor: Assembly scanning and decoration for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor)\n\n---",

    "question": "What is a protection proxy and how is it implemented?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### Protection Proxy in C#\n\nA **protection proxy** is a structural design pattern that controls access to an object by providing a surrogate or placeholder. The proxy intercepts requests to the real object and determines whether the client has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation. This is particularly useful for implementing security, authorization, or access control in your application.\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Purpose:** Restrict access to sensitive objects based on user roles, permissions, or other criteria.\n- **How it works:** The proxy implements the same interface as the real object and delegates calls to it only if access is allowed.\n\n---\n\n#### Example Implementation\n\nSuppose you have a `IDocument` interface and a `Document` class. You want to restrict access to the `Read` and `Write` methods based on user roles.\n\n```csharp\n// Subject Interface\npublic interface IDocument\n{\n    void Read();\n    void Write(string content);\n}\n\n// Real Subject\npublic class Document : IDocument\n{\n    private string _content = \"Confidential Document\";\n\n    public void Read()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(_content);\n    }\n\n    public void Write(string content)\n    {\n        _content = content;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Document updated.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Protection Proxy\npublic class DocumentProtectionProxy : IDocument\n{\n    private readonly Document _document;\n    private readonly string _userRole;\n\n    public DocumentProtectionProxy(Document document, string userRole)\n    {\n        _document = document;\n        _userRole = userRole;\n    }\n\n    public void Read()\n    {\n        // All users can read\n        _document.Read();\n    }\n\n    public void Write(string content)\n    {\n        // Only Admin can write\n        if (_userRole == \"Admin\")\n        {\n            _document.Write(content);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Access Denied: You do not have write permissions.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```csharp\nIDocument doc = new DocumentProtectionProxy(new Document(), \"User\");\ndoc.Read();  // Allowed\ndoc.Write(\"New Content\");  // Access Denied\n\nIDocument adminDoc = new DocumentProtectionProxy(new Document(), \"Admin\");\nadminDoc.Write(\"Admin Content\");  // Allowed\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Component         | Role                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Subject           | Interface or abstract class (e.g., `IDocument`)   |\n| Real Subject      | The actual object (e.g., `Document`)              |\n| Protection Proxy  | Controls access (e.g., `DocumentProtectionProxy`) |\n\n---\n\n### When to Use\n\n- When you need to control access to sensitive objects.\n- When you want to add security checks without modifying the real object.\n- When you want to centralize authorization logic.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nA protection proxy in C# is implemented by creating a proxy class that checks access rights before delegating calls to the real object, thus enforcing security and access control transparently.",

    "question": "How does the Facade pattern help in migrating legacy systems?",
    "answer": "```markdown The **Facade pattern** is particularly useful when migrating legacy systems because it provides a simplified, unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Here’s how it helps:\n\n### 1. **Encapsulation of Legacy Complexity**\nLegacy systems often have complex, hard-to-understand APIs. The Facade pattern allows you to wrap this complexity behind a new, cleaner interface, making it easier for new code to interact with the legacy system.\n\n```csharp\n// Legacy system\npublic class LegacyBillingSystem {\n    public void Initialize() { /* ... */ }\n    public void ProcessPayment(string account, decimal amount) { /* ... */ }\n    public void Close() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Facade\npublic class BillingFacade {\n    private LegacyBillingSystem _legacy = new LegacyBillingSystem();\n\n    public void PayBill(string account, decimal amount) {\n        _legacy.Initialize();\n        _legacy.ProcessPayment(account, amount);\n        _legacy.Close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Decoupling New Code from Legacy Code**\nBy using a facade, new components interact only with the facade, not directly with the legacy system. This decoupling makes it easier to replace or refactor the legacy system in the future.\n\n### 3. **Incremental Migration**\nYou can gradually replace parts of the legacy system behind the facade without affecting the rest of the application. The facade acts as a stable interface during the migration process.\n\n### 4. **Improved Maintainability**\nThe facade centralizes the integration logic, making maintenance and future enhancements easier and less error-prone.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Facade pattern streamlines the migration of legacy systems by hiding complexity, decoupling new code, enabling incremental migration, and improving maintainability. This makes the transition smoother and less risky.",

    "question": "Describe a use case for combining Facade and Adapter patterns.",
    "answer": "```markdown Certainly!\n\n## Combining Facade and Adapter Patterns in C#\n\n### Use Case: Integrating a Legacy Subsystem with a Simplified API\n\nSuppose you are developing a new application that needs to interact with a complex legacy subsystem (e.g., an old billing system). The subsystem exposes multiple classes with convoluted interfaces, and its API is not compatible with your new application's expectations.\n\n#### Problem\n\n- The legacy subsystem is difficult to use directly due to its complexity.\n- The subsystem's interfaces do not match the interfaces expected by your new application.\n\n#### Solution\n\n**Combine the Facade and Adapter patterns:**\n\n1. **Facade Pattern:**  \n   Create a Facade class that provides a simplified, unified interface to the complex legacy subsystem. The Facade internally coordinates calls to the various classes and methods of the subsystem, hiding its complexity from the client.\n\n2. **Adapter Pattern:**  \n   If the Facade's interface still does not match what your application expects (for example, due to method signatures or naming conventions), implement an Adapter. The Adapter wraps the Facade and translates its interface into the one required by your application.\n\n#### Example Structure\n\n```csharp\n// Legacy subsystem\nclass OldBillingSystem { /* Complex API */ }\nclass OldInvoiceManager { /* Complex API */ }\n\n// Facade\nclass BillingFacade\n{\n    private OldBillingSystem _billingSystem = new OldBillingSystem();\n    private OldInvoiceManager _invoiceManager = new OldInvoiceManager();\n\n    public void ProcessPayment(string customerId, decimal amount)\n    {\n        // Internally coordinates calls to the legacy subsystem\n    }\n}\n\n// Target interface expected by the new application\npublic interface IPaymentProcessor\n{\n    void Pay(string userId, double amount);\n}\n\n// Adapter\nclass BillingAdapter : IPaymentProcessor\n{\n    private BillingFacade _facade = new BillingFacade();\n\n    public void Pay(string userId, double amount)\n    {\n        // Adapts the interface and delegates to the Facade\n        _facade.ProcessPayment(userId, (decimal)amount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Facade** simplifies the interaction with the legacy subsystem.\n- **Adapter** ensures compatibility with the new application's expected interface.\n- This combination allows you to encapsulate complexity and achieve interface compatibility without modifying the legacy code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nCombine Facade and Adapter patterns when you need to both simplify a complex subsystem and adapt its interface to match the requirements of your new application. The Facade hides complexity, while the Adapter ensures interface compatibility.",

    "answer": "```markdown The **Bridge** and **Strategy** patterns are both structural and behavioral design patterns in C#, but they serve different purposes and are applied in distinct scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Bridge Pattern\n\n**Intent:**  \nDecouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.\n\n**Structure:**  \n- Involves two hierarchies: one for abstraction and one for implementation.\n- The abstraction contains a reference to the implementation interface.\n- Changes in abstraction or implementation do not affect each other.\n\n**Use Case Example:**  \nWhen you have multiple dimensions of variation (e.g., shapes and rendering APIs), and you want to avoid a combinatorial explosion of subclasses.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n```\nAbstraction ----> Implementor\n     |                ^\n  RefinedAbstraction   |\n                      |\n                 ConcreteImplementor\n```\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Pattern\n\n**Intent:**  \nDefine a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.\n\n**Structure:**  \n- Context class maintains a reference to a Strategy interface.\n- Strategies encapsulate different algorithms or behaviors.\n- The client can switch strategies at runtime.\n\n**Use Case Example:**  \nWhen you want to switch between different algorithms (e.g., sorting methods) at runtime.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n```\nContext ----> Strategy\n                ^\n                |\n           ConcreteStrategyA\n           ConcreteStrategyB\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences\n\n| Aspect           | Bridge Pattern                                         | Strategy Pattern                               |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose          | Decouple abstraction from implementation               | Encapsulate interchangeable algorithms         |\n| Pattern Type     | Structural                                            | Behavioral                                     |\n| Hierarchies      | Two parallel hierarchies (abstraction & implementation)| One hierarchy (algorithms/behaviors)           |\n| Client Role      | Client defines abstraction, selects implementation     | Client selects which strategy to use           |\n| Example          | Shape (abstraction) & Renderer (implementation)        | Sorting (strategy) in a collection class       |\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Bridge** is about separating abstraction from implementation to allow both to evolve independently.\n- **Strategy** is about encapsulating algorithms and making them interchangeable within a context.\n\n**In C#:**  \n- Use **Bridge** when you have orthogonal class hierarchies that should not be tightly coupled.\n- Use **Strategy** when you need to swap algorithms or behaviors at runtime without modifying the context.",

    "question": "What is the impact of structural patterns on code maintainability?",
    "answer": "```markdown Structural patterns in C# (such as Adapter, Facade, Composite, Decorator, Bridge, and Proxy) have a significant positive impact on code maintainability. Here’s how:\n\n- **Encapsulation of Relationships:** Structural patterns help encapsulate the relationships between objects, making the system easier to understand and modify.\n- **Loose Coupling:** By abstracting how classes and objects interact, these patterns reduce dependencies. This means changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect others.\n- **Reusability:** Components built using structural patterns are often more reusable, as they are designed to work with different implementations.\n- **Simplified Complexity:** Patterns like Facade and Composite can hide complex subsystems or hierarchies behind simple interfaces, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.\n- **Flexibility:** Patterns such as Decorator and Bridge allow for dynamic extension or variation of behavior without modifying existing code.\n\n**Example:**  \nUsing the Adapter pattern, you can integrate a new component into your system without changing existing code, thus minimizing the risk of introducing bugs and making future maintenance easier.\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Pattern    | Maintainability Benefit                  |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Adapter    | Integrates incompatible interfaces      |\n| Facade     | Simplifies complex subsystems           |\n| Composite  | Manages hierarchies uniformly           |\n| Decorator  | Adds behavior without altering code     |\n| Bridge     | Separates abstraction from implementation|\n| Proxy      | Controls access and adds functionality  |\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nStructural patterns in C# promote cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code by organizing relationships and dependencies in a flexible and robust way.",

    "question": "How can you test classes that use the Decorator pattern?",
    "answer": "```markdown To test classes that use the Decorator pattern in C#, you should focus on verifying both the behavior of the base component and the added responsibilities introduced by the decorators. Here’s how you can approach testing:\n\n```csharp\n// Example interfaces and classes\npublic interface INotifier\n{\n    void Send(string message);\n}\n\npublic class EmailNotifier : INotifier\n{\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        // Send email logic\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SmsDecorator : INotifier\n{\n    private readonly INotifier _wrappee;\n\n    public SmsDecorator(INotifier wrappee)\n    {\n        _wrappee = wrappee;\n    }\n\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        _wrappee.Send(message);\n        // Send SMS logic\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 1. Test the Base Component\n\nWrite unit tests for the core component to ensure its functionality is correct.\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void EmailNotifier_Send_SendsEmail()\n{\n    var notifier = new EmailNotifier();\n    // Use mocks or assertions to verify email sending\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Test the Decorator in Isolation\n\nUse mocks or stubs for the wrapped component to verify that the decorator:\n\n- Calls the wrapped component as expected.\n- Adds its own behavior.\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void SmsDecorator_Send_CallsWrappedSendAndSendsSms()\n{\n    var mockNotifier = new Mock<INotifier>();\n    var decorator = new SmsDecorator(mockNotifier.Object);\n\n    decorator.Send(\"Hello\");\n\n    mockNotifier.Verify(n => n.Send(\"Hello\"), Times.Once());\n    // Assert SMS sending logic (could use additional mocks or flags)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Test Decorator Chains\n\nIf decorators are chained, test the combined behavior:\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void MultipleDecorators_Send_AllBehaviorsApplied()\n{\n    var mockNotifier = new Mock<INotifier>();\n    var smsDecorator = new SmsDecorator(mockNotifier.Object);\n    var anotherDecorator = new AnotherDecorator(smsDecorator);\n\n    anotherDecorator.Send(\"Hello\");\n\n    mockNotifier.Verify(n => n.Send(\"Hello\"), Times.Once());\n    // Assert additional behaviors\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Use Dependency Injection and Mocks\n\nUtilize dependency injection and mocking frameworks (like Moq) to isolate and verify interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo test classes using the Decorator pattern, write unit tests for both the base component and each decorator. Use mocks to verify that decorators correctly delegate calls and add their own behavior. Also, test combinations of decorators to ensure correct composition.",

    "question": "How do you avoid memory leaks when using the Flyweight pattern?",
    "answer": "```markdown To avoid memory leaks when using the **Flyweight** pattern in C#, you should ensure that unused flyweight objects are properly released and not kept alive longer than necessary. Here are some best practices:\n\n### 1. Use Weak References\n\nInstead of storing strong references to flyweight objects, use `WeakReference<T>`. This allows the garbage collector to reclaim the memory if there are no other strong references to the object.\n\n```csharp\nclass FlyweightFactory\n{\n    private Dictionary<string, WeakReference<Flyweight>> _flyweights = new();\n\n    public Flyweight GetFlyweight(string key)\n    {\n        if (_flyweights.TryGetValue(key, out var weakRef) && weakRef.TryGetTarget(out var flyweight))\n        {\n            return flyweight;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            var newFlyweight = new Flyweight(key);\n            _flyweights[key] = new WeakReference<Flyweight>(newFlyweight);\n            return newFlyweight;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Clean Up Unused Flyweights\n\nPeriodically remove entries whose targets have been garbage collected:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Cleanup()\n{\n    var keysToRemove = _flyweights\n        .Where(kvp => !kvp.Value.TryGetTarget(out _))\n        .Select(kvp => kvp.Key)\n        .ToList();\n\n    foreach (var key in keysToRemove)\n    {\n        _flyweights.Remove(key);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Avoid Static References\n\nDo not store flyweight objects in static fields unless they are truly needed for the application's lifetime. Static references prevent garbage collection.\n\n### 4. Use Value Types When Possible\n\nIf the flyweight objects are small and immutable, consider using value types (structs) to avoid heap allocations and reference management altogether.\n\n### 5. Document Ownership\n\nMake it clear in your code who owns the flyweight objects and who is responsible for releasing them, especially if you use custom caching strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Technique                  | Purpose                                  |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| WeakReference<T>           | Allow GC to reclaim unused flyweights    |\n| Periodic Cleanup           | Remove dead references from cache        |\n| Avoid Static References    | Prevent unintentional object retention   |\n| Use Value Types            | Minimize heap allocations                |\n| Document Ownership         | Clarify lifecycle management             |\n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively avoid memory leaks when implementing the Flyweight pattern in C#.",

    "question": "Can the Composite pattern be used for UI component hierarchies? How?",
    "answer": "```markdown Yes, the Composite pattern is commonly used for UI component hierarchies in C#. The Composite pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In the context of UI, this means you can treat both single UI elements (like a Button or TextBox) and groups of elements (like Panels or Windows containing other controls) in the same way.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Component Interface:** Define a common interface or abstract class for all UI components. This interface typically includes methods like Draw(), Add(), Remove(), etc.\n\n2. **Leaf:** Implement the interface for basic UI elements (e.g., Button, TextBox). These are the \"leaf\" nodes and do not contain child components.\n\n3. **Composite:** Implement the interface for composite UI elements (e.g., Panel, Window). These can contain child components (both leaves and other composites).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Component\npublic abstract class UIComponent\n{\n    public abstract void Draw();\n    public virtual void Add(UIComponent component) { }\n    public virtual void Remove(UIComponent component) { }\n}\n\n// Leaf\npublic class Button : UIComponent\n{\n    public override void Draw()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Drawing a Button\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Composite\npublic class Panel : UIComponent\n{\n    private List<UIComponent> _children = new List<UIComponent>();\n\n    public override void Draw()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Drawing a Panel\");\n        foreach (var child in _children)\n        {\n            child.Draw();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public override void Add(UIComponent component)\n    {\n        _children.Add(component);\n    }\n\n    public override void Remove(UIComponent component)\n    {\n        _children.Remove(component);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```csharp\nvar panel = new Panel();\npanel.Add(new Button());\npanel.Add(new Button());\n\nvar subPanel = new Panel();\nsubPanel.Add(new Button());\n\npanel.Add(subPanel);\n\npanel.Draw();\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nDrawing a Panel\nDrawing a Button\nDrawing a Button\nDrawing a Panel\nDrawing a Button\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Composite pattern is ideal for building UI hierarchies, as it enables you to treat both individual UI elements and groups of elements uniformly, simplifying rendering, event handling, and management of complex UI structures. Many UI frameworks (like WinForms, WPF, and others) use this pattern internally.",

    "answer": "```markdown Interfaces play a crucial role in implementing structural patterns in C#. Structural patterns, such as Adapter, Facade, Decorator, and Proxy, focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Interfaces help by:\n\n- **Defining Contracts:** Interfaces specify a set of methods and properties that implementing classes must provide. This allows different classes to be used interchangeably if they implement the same interface.\n- **Promoting Flexibility:** By programming to interfaces rather than concrete classes, structural patterns enable flexible and reusable code. For example, an Adapter can make two incompatible interfaces work together by implementing the expected interface.\n- **Supporting Decoupling:** Interfaces help decouple the code that uses an object from the code that implements the object, making it easier to change or extend the system.\n\n**Example:**  \nIn the Adapter pattern, an interface defines the methods expected by the client. The adapter class implements this interface and translates calls to the methods of an incompatible class.\n\n```csharp\n// Target interface\npublic interface ITarget\n{\n    void Request();\n}\n\n// Adaptee class\npublic class Adaptee\n{\n    public void SpecificRequest()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Called SpecificRequest()\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Adapter class\npublic class Adapter : ITarget\n{\n    private Adaptee _adaptee = new Adaptee();\n\n    public void Request()\n    {\n        _adaptee.SpecificRequest();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, interfaces are essential in structural patterns for defining clear contracts, enabling flexibility, and supporting the composition of objects in C#.",
