            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'params' keyword in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `params` keyword in C# is used to specify a method parameter that takes a variable number of arguments. It allows you to pass a comma-separated list of arguments of the same type to a method, or even an array of that type. This is particularly useful when the exact number of arguments is not known at compile time.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. A method can only have one `params` parameter, and it must be the last parameter in the method's parameter list.\n2. The `params` parameter can accept zero or more arguments.\n3. If no arguments are passed for the `params` parameter, it defaults to an empty array.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void PrintNumbers(params int[] numbers)\n    {\n        foreach (int number in numbers)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(number);\n        }\n    }\n\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        PrintNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // Passing multiple arguments\n        PrintNumbers(); // Passing no arguments\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\nThe `params` keyword simplifies method calls and makes the code more flexible when dealing with a variable number of inputs.\n```",

It is a user-defined data type that acts as a prototype for creating objects. A class itself does not occupy memory until an object is created from it.\n\nAn **object**, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that is created based on the class definition and occupies memory. Objects are used to access the members (properties, methods, etc.) defined in the class.\n\n### Key Differences:\n| **Class**                          | **Object**                          |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| A class is a logical construct.    | An object is a physical instance.   |\n| It defines the structure and behavior. | It represents an actual entity.    |\n| Does not occupy memory by itself.  | Occupies memory when created.       |\n| Example: `class Car { ... }`       | Example: `Car myCar = new Car();`   |\n\nIn summary, a class is the definition, while an object is the realization of that definition.\n```",

            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'using' keyword in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `using` keyword in C# serves two main purposes:\n\n1. **Namespace Inclusion**: It allows you to include namespaces in your code, enabling you to access classes, methods, and other members defined in those namespaces without needing to use their fully qualified names. For example:\n   ```csharp\n   using System;\n\n   class Program\n   {\n       static void Main()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Resource Management**: It is used to ensure that unmanaged resources (like file handles, database connections, etc.) are properly disposed of when they are no longer needed. This is done by creating a `using` statement block that automatically calls the `Dispose` method on objects that implement the `IDisposable` interface. For example:\n   ```csharp\n   using (var file = new System.IO.StreamWriter(\"example.txt\"))\n   {\n       file.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n   }\n   // The file is automatically closed and disposed of here.\n   ```\n\nIn summary, the `using` keyword is essential for both simplifying code readability and ensuring proper resource management in C#.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, types are categorized into two main types: **Value Types** and **Reference Types**.\n\n### Value Types\n- Value types store the actual data directly in their memory allocation.\n- They are stored in the stack, which makes them faster to access.\n- Examples of value types include:\n  - Primitive types like `int`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, `char`\n  - Structs (`struct`) and Enumerations (`enum`)\n- When a value type is assigned to another value type, a copy of the value is made.\n\n#### Example:\n```csharp\nint a = 10;\nint b = a; // b gets a copy of the value of a\nb = 20;    // Changing b does not affect a\nConsole.WriteLine(a); // Output: 10\n```\n\n### Reference Types\n- Reference types store a reference (or address) to the memory location where the actual data is stored.\n- They are stored in the heap, and the reference to the data is stored in the stack.\n- Examples of reference types include:\n  - Classes (`class`)\n  - Interfaces\n  - Delegates\n  - Arrays\n  - Strings\n- When a reference type is assigned to another reference type, both variables refer to the same memory location.\n\n#### Example:\n```csharp\nclass Person\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n\nPerson person1 = new Person { Name = \"Alice\" };\nPerson person2 = person1; // person2 refers to the same object as person1\nperson2.Name = \"Bob\";     // Changing person2's Name also affects person1\nConsole.WriteLine(person1.Name); // Output: Bob\n```\n\n### Key Differences\n| **Aspect**        | **Value Types**                     | **Reference Types**                  |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Storage**        | Stored in the stack                | Stored in the heap                   |\n| **Data Handling**  | Contains actual data               | Contains a reference to the data     |\n| **Assignment**     | Creates a copy of the value        | Copies the reference (points to the same object) |\n| **Performance**    | Faster due to stack allocation     | Slower due to heap allocation        |\n\nUnderstanding the difference between value types and reference types is crucial for managing memory and avoiding unintended side effects in your C# programs.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, `==` and `.Equals()` are used to compare objects, but they work differently:\n\n1. **`==` Operator**:\n   - The `==` operator is used to compare the values of two objects.\n   - For value types (e.g., `int`, `float`), it checks if the values are equal.\n   - For reference types (e.g., objects, strings), it checks if the references (memory addresses) are the same, unless the `==` operator is overridden in the class to compare values.\n\n2. **`.Equals()` Method**:\n   - The `.Equals()` method is used to determine whether two objects are equal.\n   - By default, the base implementation in the `Object` class checks for reference equality (same memory address).\n   - However, many types (e.g., `string`, custom classes) override `.Equals()` to perform value-based comparisons.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- `==` can be overridden by a type to provide custom behavior, while `.Equals()` is a method that can also be overridden for custom equality logic.\n- For strings in C#, both `==` and `.Equals()` compare the values of the strings because the `string` class overrides both for value comparison.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\nstring str1 = \"hello\";\nstring str2 = \"hello\";\n\nConsole.WriteLine(str1 == str2);       // True (compares values)\nConsole.WriteLine(str1.Equals(str2)); // True (compares values)\n\nobject obj1 = new object();\nobject obj2 = new object();\n\nConsole.WriteLine(obj1 == obj2);       // False (compares references)\nConsole.WriteLine(obj1.Equals(obj2)); // False (default reference equality)\n```\n\n### Summary:\n- Use `==` for general equality checks, especially for primitive types or when overridden for value comparison.\n- Use `.Equals()` when you want to explicitly check for value equality, especially for objects where `.Equals()` has been overridden.\n```",

It provides a hierarchical structure to manage code and avoid naming conflicts between different parts of a program or between different libraries.\n\n### Why is it used?\n1. **Avoid Naming Conflicts**: Namespaces help prevent naming collisions by encapsulating code elements within a specific context. For example, two classes with the same name can exist in different namespaces without conflict.\n2. **Code Organization**: They make the codebase more structured and easier to navigate by grouping related functionalities together.\n3. **Reusability**: Namespaces allow developers to reuse code from libraries or frameworks without worrying about conflicts with existing code.\n4. **Readability**: Using namespaces improves the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace MyApplication\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `System` is a namespace that provides access to built-in classes like `Console`.\n- `MyApplication` is a custom namespace that contains the `Program` class.\n```\n",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, the `static` keyword is used to declare members (fields, methods, properties, etc.) or classes that belong to the type itself rather than to a specific instance of the type. This means that `static` members are shared across all instances of the class and can be accessed without creating an object of the class.\n\n### Key Points About `static`:\n1. **Static Members**:\n   - Declared using the `static` keyword.\n   - Can be accessed using the class name (e.g., `ClassName.StaticMember`).\n   - Useful for defining utility methods or shared data.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class MathHelper\n   {\n       public static int Add(int a, int b)\n       {\n           return a + b;\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Usage\n   int result = MathHelper.Add(5, 3); // No need to create an instance\n   ```\n\n2. **Static Classes**:\n   - A class can be declared as `static` if all its members are static.\n   - Cannot be instantiated or inherited.\n   - Typically used for utility or helper classes.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public static class Utility\n   {\n       public static void PrintMessage(string message)\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(message);\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Usage\n   Utility.PrintMessage(\"Hello, World!\");\n   ```\n\n3. **Static Constructors**:\n   - A special constructor used to initialize static members of a class.\n   - Called automatically before any static member is accessed or any instance is created.\n   - Cannot take parameters and is defined using the `static` keyword.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class Config\n   {\n       public static string AppName;\n\n       static Config()\n       {\n           AppName = \"My Application\";\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Usage\n   Console.WriteLine(Config.AppName);\n   ```\n\n4. **Static Variables**:\n   - Shared across all instances of the class.\n   - Retain their value between method calls.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class Counter\n   {\n       public static int Count = 0;\n\n       public void Increment()\n       {\n           Count++;\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Usage\n   Counter c1 = new Counter();\n   c1.Increment();\n   Console.WriteLine(Counter.Count); // Output: 1\n   ```\n\n### Summary:\nThe `static` keyword is used to define members or classes that are shared and do not require an instance to be accessed. It is particularly useful for creating utility classes, shared data, or methods that do not depend on instance-specific data.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nPolymorphism in C# is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms,\" and in C#, it enables a single method, property, or operator to behave differently based on the context or the object it is acting upon.\n\n### Types of Polymorphism in C#\n1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**:\n   - Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.\n   - The method to be invoked is determined at compile time.\n\n   **Example of Method Overloading**:\n   ```csharp\n   public class Calculator\n   {\n       public int Add(int a, int b)\n       {\n           return a + b;\n       }\n\n       public double Add(double a, double b)\n       {\n           return a + b;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**:\n   - Achieved through method overriding using inheritance.\n   - The method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.\n\n   **Example of Method Overriding**:\n   ```csharp\n   public class Animal\n   {\n       public virtual void Speak()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Animal speaks\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   public class Dog : Animal\n   {\n       public override void Speak()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Dog barks\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   public class Cat : Animal\n   {\n       public override void Speak()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Cat meows\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   public class Program\n   {\n       public static void Main()\n       {\n           Animal animal;\n\n           animal = new Dog();\n           animal.Speak(); // Output: Dog barks\n\n           animal = new Cat();\n           animal.Speak(); // Output: Cat meows\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Key Points\n- **Method Overloading**: Same method name with different parameters (compile-time polymorphism).\n- **Method Overriding**: Using the `virtual` keyword in the base class and the `override` keyword in the derived class (runtime polymorphism).\n- Polymorphism promotes code reusability and flexibility by allowing methods to behave differently based on the object type.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\n### Delegates in C#\n\nA delegate in C# is a type that represents references to methods with a specific signature and return type. Delegates are similar to function pointers in C or C++, but they are type-safe and object-oriented. They allow methods to be passed as parameters, enabling dynamic method invocation.\n\n#### Key Features of Delegates:\n1. **Type-Safe**: Delegates ensure that the method signature matches the delegate signature.\n2. **Multicast Support**: A delegate can reference multiple methods, allowing invocation of all methods in the invocation list.\n3. **Encapsulation**: Delegates encapsulate method references, enabling dynamic behavior at runtime.\n4. **Event Handling**: Delegates are commonly used in event-driven programming to define and handle events.\n\n#### Syntax for Declaring and Using Delegates:\n1. **Declaration**:\n   ```csharp\n   public delegate void MyDelegate(string message);\n   ```\n   Here, `MyDelegate` is a delegate type that can reference methods with a `void` return type and a single `string` parameter.\n\n2. **Instantiation**:\n   ```csharp\n   MyDelegate del = new MyDelegate(SomeMethod);\n   ```\n   Alternatively, you can use shorthand:\n   ```csharp\n   MyDelegate del = SomeMethod;\n   ```\n\n3. **Invocation**:\n   ```csharp\n   del(\"Hello, World!\");\n   ```\n\n#### Example:\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    // Define a delegate\n    public delegate void PrintMessage(string message);\n\n    // Method matching the delegate signature\n    public static void PrintToConsole(string message)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(message);\n    }\n\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        // Instantiate the delegate\n        PrintMessage printDelegate = PrintToConsole;\n\n        // Invoke the delegate\n        printDelegate(\"Hello, Delegates!\");\n\n        // Multicast delegate example\n        printDelegate += AnotherMethod;\n        printDelegate(\"Multicast Example\");\n    }\n\n    public static void AnotherMethod(string message)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Another Method: \" + message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Use Cases of Delegates:\n1. **Event Handling**: Delegates are the foundation of events in C#.\n2. **Callback Mechanisms**: Delegates can be used to implement callback methods.\n3. **Encapsulation**: They allow encapsulation of method references for dynamic invocation.\n\n#### Built-in Delegates:\nC# provides several built-in generic delegates such as:\n- `Action`: Represents a method that returns void and can take up to 16 parameters.\n- `Func`: Represents a method that returns a value and can take up to 16 parameters.\n- `Predicate`: Represents a method that takes one parameter and returns a `bool`.\n\nExample with `Func`:\n```csharp\nFunc<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;\nConsole.WriteLine(add(3, 5)); // Output: 8\n```\n\nDelegates are a powerful feature in C# that enable flexible and dynamic programming patterns.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, an event is a mechanism that allows a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs. It is a way to implement the observer design pattern, enabling communication between objects in a loosely coupled manner.\n\nAn event is declared using the `event` keyword and is typically associated with a delegate type. Delegates define the signature of the methods that can handle the event. When an event is raised, all the methods subscribed to it (event handlers) are invoked.\n\n### How Events Work in C#\n1. **Declaration**: An event is declared in a class using the `event` keyword along with a delegate type.\n2. **Subscription**: Other classes or objects can subscribe to the event by attaching event handler methods using the `+=` operator.\n3. **Raising the Event**: The event is triggered (raised) by the class that owns it, usually when a specific condition or action occurs.\n4. **Unsubscription**: Objects can unsubscribe from the event using the `-=` operator to stop receiving notifications.\n\n### Example\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Publisher\n{\n    // Declare an event using a delegate\n    public event EventHandler SomethingHappened;\n\n    public void TriggerEvent()\n    {\n        // Raise the event (check for null to ensure there are subscribers)\n        SomethingHappened?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Subscriber\n{\n    public void OnSomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Event received by Subscriber.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();\n        Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();\n\n        // Subscribe to the event\n        publisher.SomethingHappened += subscriber.OnSomethingHappened;\n\n        // Trigger the event\n        publisher.TriggerEvent();\n\n        // Output: \"Event received by Subscriber.\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n- Events are based on delegates and provide a way to encapsulate the delegate's invocation list.\n- The `event` keyword restricts direct access to the delegate, ensuring only the owning class can raise the event.\n- Events promote loose coupling, as the publisher does not need to know the details of the subscribers.\n- Always check for `null` before raising an event to avoid `NullReferenceException` if no subscribers are attached.\n\nEvents are widely used in C# for implementing notifications, such as in GUI programming or handling asynchronous operations.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, both `ref` and `out` are used to pass arguments by reference to a method, allowing the method to modify the value of the parameter. However, there are key differences between the two:\n\n1. **Initialization Requirement**:\n   - `ref`: The variable passed as a `ref` parameter must be initialized before it is passed to the method.\n   - `out`: The variable passed as an `out` parameter does not need to be initialized before being passed. However, it must be assigned a value inside the method before the method returns.\n\n2. **Purpose**:\n   - `ref`: Used when the variable is already initialized and you want the method to read and/or modify its value.\n   - `out`: Used when the method is expected to initialize or assign a value to the variable and return it to the caller.\n\n3. **Usage in Method Signature**:\n   - Both `ref` and `out` must be explicitly specified in both the method definition and the method call.\n\n4. **Example**:\n\n   ```csharp\n   using System;\n\n   class Program\n   {\n       static void Main()\n       {\n           int refValue = 10;\n           int outValue;\n\n           ModifyRef(ref refValue);\n           Console.WriteLine($\"refValue after method call: {refValue}\");\n\n           ModifyOut(out outValue);\n           Console.WriteLine($\"outValue after method call: {outValue}\");\n       }\n\n       static void ModifyRef(ref int value)\n       {\n           value += 10; // Modifies the existing value\n       }\n\n       static void ModifyOut(out int value)\n       {\n           value = 20; // Must assign a value before returning\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Compiler Enforcement**:\n   - The compiler enforces that `ref` variables are initialized before being passed to the method.\n   - The compiler enforces that `out` variables are assigned a value inside the method before it returns.\n\nIn summary, use `ref` when you want to pass an already initialized variable and allow the method to modify it. Use `out` when you want the method to initialize or assign a value to the variable and return it to the caller.\n```",

            "question": "What are generics in C# and how do they improve code reusability?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nGenerics in C# are a feature that allows you to define classes, interfaces, methods, and delegates with a placeholder for the type of data they operate on. This placeholder is specified using type parameters, which are defined using angle brackets (`<>`). Generics enable type-safe and reusable code by allowing you to write a single implementation that works with any data type.\n\n### Key Benefits of Generics:\n1. **Type Safety**: Generics enforce compile-time type checking, reducing runtime errors. For example, when using a `List<T>`, you can only add items of type `T`, preventing invalid type assignments.\n2. **Code Reusability**: You can write a generic class or method once and use it with different data types without duplicating code. This reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.\n3. **Performance**: Generics eliminate the need for boxing and unboxing when working with value types, which improves performance and reduces memory overhead.\n4. **Flexibility**: Generics allow you to create highly flexible and extensible code structures, such as collections, algorithms, and utilities.\n\n### Example of Generics in C#:\n```csharp\n// Generic class\npublic class GenericRepository<T>\n{\n    private List<T> items = new List<T>();\n\n    public void Add(T item)\n    {\n        items.Add(item);\n    }\n\n    public T Get(int index)\n    {\n        return items[index];\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar intRepository = new GenericRepository<int>();\nintRepository.Add(10);\nint value = intRepository.Get(0);\n\nvar stringRepository = new GenericRepository<string>();\nstringRepository.Add(\"Hello\");\nstring text = stringRepository.Get(0);\n```\n\n### How Generics Improve Code Reusability:\n1. **Single Implementation for Multiple Types**: Instead of creating separate classes or methods for each data type, you can use generics to handle all types with a single implementation.\n2. **Customizable Behavior**: Generics allow you to define constraints (using `where` clauses) to restrict the types that can be used, enabling more specific and reusable designs.\n3. **Reduced Code Duplication**: By leveraging generics, you avoid duplicating logic for different types, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.\n\nGenerics are extensively used in the .NET Framework, especially in collections (e.g., `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`), LINQ, and many other libraries, making them a cornerstone of modern C# programming.\n```",

This is useful when you want to restrict inheritance and ensure that the functionality of the class remains unchanged.\n   ```csharp\n   sealed class MyClass\n   {\n       public void Display()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"This is a sealed class.\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   // The following would result in a compilation error:\n   // class DerivedClass : MyClass { }\n   ```\n\n2. **Sealing a Method**: When a method in a derived class is marked as `sealed`, it prevents further overriding of that method in any classes that derive from the current class. This is typically done in combination with the `override` keyword.\n   ```csharp\n   class BaseClass\n   {\n       public virtual void Display()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Base class display method.\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   class DerivedClass : BaseClass\n   {\n       public sealed override void Display()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Derived class sealed display method.\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   // The following would result in a compilation error:\n   // class FurtherDerivedClass : DerivedClass\n   // {\n   //     public override void Display() { }\n   // }\n   ```\n\n### Key Points:\n- A `sealed` class cannot be inherited.\n- A `sealed` method cannot be overridden further.\n- The `sealed` keyword is often used to enforce design constraints and improve performance by preventing unnecessary inheritance or overriding.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\n### Extension Methods in C#\n\nExtension methods in C# allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type or creating a new derived type. They are a special kind of static method that can be called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. This feature is particularly useful when you want to enhance the functionality of a class, struct, or interface without altering its source code.\n\n#### Key Characteristics of Extension Methods:\n1. They are defined as static methods in a static class.\n2. The first parameter of the method specifies the type it extends, and it must be preceded by the `this` keyword.\n3. They are invoked using instance method syntax, even though they are static methods.\n\n#### How to Implement Extension Methods\n\nHere is an example of implementing and using an extension method:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace ExtensionMethodExample\n{\n    // Define a static class to hold the extension method\n    public static class StringExtensions\n    {\n        // Define the extension method\n        public static bool IsPalindrome(this string str)\n        {\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(str))\n                return false;\n\n            int start = 0;\n            int end = str.Length - 1;\n\n            while (start < end)\n            {\n                if (str[start] != str[end])\n                    return false;\n\n                start++;\n                end--;\n            }\n\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            string word = \"radar\";\n\n            // Call the extension method as if it were an instance method\n            bool isPalindrome = word.IsPalindrome();\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Is '{word}' a palindrome? {isPalindrome}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Explanation of the Example:\n1. The `IsPalindrome` method is defined in a static class `StringExtensions`.\n2. The `this` keyword in the first parameter (`this string str`) indicates that the method extends the `string` type.\n3. In the `Main` method, the `IsPalindrome` method is called on a `string` instance (`word`), even though it is a static method.\n\n#### Benefits of Extension Methods:\n- They provide a way to add functionality to existing types without modifying their source code.\n- They improve code readability and maintainability by allowing methods to be called in a natural, instance-like manner.\n- They are particularly useful for extending sealed classes or third-party libraries.\n\n#### Limitations of Extension Methods:\n- They cannot access private or protected members of the type they extend.\n- If a method with the same name already exists in the type, the extension method will not be called unless explicitly invoked using the static class name.\n```\n",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, the `async` and `await` keywords are used to work with asynchronous programming, allowing developers to write non-blocking, responsive code. Here's their purpose:\n\n1. **`async` Keyword**:\n   - The `async` modifier is applied to a method, lambda, or anonymous function to indicate that it contains asynchronous operations.\n   - It enables the use of the `await` keyword within the method.\n   - An `async` method typically returns a `Task`, `Task<T>`, or `void` (for event handlers). This allows the method to run asynchronously and return control to the caller without blocking the thread.\n\n2. **`await` Keyword**:\n   - The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an `async` method until the awaited task completes.\n   - It allows the program to continue executing other work on the same thread or a different thread while waiting for the task to finish.\n   - When the awaited task completes, execution resumes from the point where it was paused.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\npublic async Task<string> GetDataAsync()\n{\n    // Simulate an asynchronous operation\n    await Task.Delay(2000); // Pauses the method execution for 2 seconds\n    return \"Data retrieved\";\n}\n\npublic async Task MainMethodAsync()\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Fetching data...\");\n    string result = await GetDataAsync(); // Waits for GetDataAsync to complete\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n}\n```\n\n### Key Benefits:\n- **Improved Responsiveness**: The application remains responsive, especially in UI applications, as the main thread is not blocked.\n- **Simplified Asynchronous Code**: The `async` and `await` keywords make asynchronous programming easier to read and maintain compared to traditional callback-based approaches.\n\n### Notes:\n- An `async` method does not run on a separate thread by default; it uses the current thread unless explicitly specified.\n- Proper exception handling is necessary, as exceptions in asynchronous methods are captured in the returned `Task` and need to be awaited or observed.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\n### Dependency Injection in C# and Its Importance\n\n**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used in C# (and other programming languages) to achieve **Inversion of Control (IoC)**. It allows the creation of dependent objects (dependencies) outside of a class and provides those objects to the class in a controlled manner. In simpler terms, DI is a way to supply a class with its dependencies rather than letting the class create them itself.\n\n#### How Dependency Injection Works\nInstead of a class instantiating its dependencies directly, the dependencies are injected into the class, typically via:\n1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are passed through the constructor.\n2. **Property Injection**: Dependencies are assigned to public properties.\n3. **Method Injection**: Dependencies are passed as parameters to a method.\n\n#### Example of Dependency Injection\n```csharp\n// Dependency Interface\npublic interface ILogger\n{\n    void Log(string message);\n}\n\n// Dependency Implementation\npublic class ConsoleLogger : ILogger\n{\n    public void Log(string message)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(message);\n    }\n}\n\n// Class that depends on ILogger\npublic class Application\n{\n    private readonly ILogger _logger;\n\n    // Dependency is injected via the constructor\n    public Application(ILogger logger)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public void Run()\n    {\n        _logger.Log(\"Application is running...\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Main Program\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        // Dependency is created and injected\n        ILogger logger = new ConsoleLogger();\n        Application app = new Application(logger);\n        app.Run();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Importance of Dependency Injection\n1. **Improved Testability**: By injecting dependencies, you can easily replace them with mock objects during unit testing, making the code more testable.\n2. **Loose Coupling**: Classes are not tightly coupled to specific implementations of their dependencies, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n3. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to a dependency do not require changes to the classes that use it, as long as the dependency adheres to the same interface or contract.\n4. **Reusability**: Dependency injection promotes the use of interfaces and abstractions, encouraging reusable and modular code.\n5. **Adherence to SOLID Principles**: DI supports the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), which states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions.\n\n#### Built-in DI in .NET Core\nIn .NET Core and .NET 5+, Microsoft provides a built-in dependency injection container. It allows developers to register services and resolve them automatically. For example:\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Register services\nbuilder.Services.AddTransient<ILogger, ConsoleLogger>();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// Resolve and use the service\nvar logger = app.Services.GetRequiredService<ILogger>();\nlogger.Log(\"Dependency Injection in action!\");\n\napp.Run();\n```\n\nDependency Injection is a cornerstone of modern C# development, enabling scalable, maintainable, and testable applications.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\n### Garbage Collection in C#\n\nGarbage Collection (GC) in C# is an automatic memory management feature provided by the .NET runtime (CLR - Common Language Runtime). It is responsible for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer accessible or in use, thereby preventing memory leaks and optimizing application performance.\n\n#### How Garbage Collection Works\n\n1. **Managed Heap**:\n   - When objects are created in C#, they are allocated memory on the managed heap.\n   - The managed heap is divided into three generations: **Gen 0**, **Gen 1**, and **Gen 2**. These generations help optimize memory management by categorizing objects based on their lifespan.\n\n2. **Generations**:\n   - **Gen 0**: Contains short-lived objects (e.g., temporary variables). Garbage collection occurs frequently in this generation.\n   - **Gen 1**: Acts as a buffer between short-lived and long-lived objects. Objects promoted from Gen 0 are moved here if they survive a collection.\n   - **Gen 2**: Contains long-lived objects (e.g., static data, objects that persist throughout the application lifecycle). Garbage collection occurs less frequently here.\n\n3. **Garbage Collection Process**:\n   - The GC identifies objects that are no longer reachable by the application (i.e., no references point to them).\n   - It reclaims the memory occupied by these unreachable objects.\n   - For objects that are still reachable, the GC compacts the memory to reduce fragmentation and improve performance.\n   - Surviving objects are promoted to the next generation.\n\n4. **Triggering Garbage Collection**:\n   - GC is triggered automatically by the CLR when it determines that the system is running low on memory.\n   - It can also be triggered manually using the `GC.Collect()` method, though this is generally discouraged as it can disrupt the GC's optimization.\n\n5. **Finalization and Dispose**:\n   - Before reclaiming an object, the GC calls its finalizer (if defined) to allow cleanup of unmanaged resources.\n   - For deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources, the `IDisposable` interface and the `Dispose` method should be implemented.\n\n6. **GC Modes**:\n   - The .NET GC supports different modes such as **Workstation GC** (optimized for desktop applications) and **Server GC** (optimized for server applications with high throughput).\n\n#### Key Benefits of Garbage Collection\n- **Automatic Memory Management**: Reduces the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation.\n- **Prevention of Memory Leaks**: Ensures that unused objects are removed from memory.\n- **Improved Performance**: Optimizes memory usage by compacting the heap and reducing fragmentation.\n\n#### Limitations of Garbage Collection\n- **Non-Deterministic**: The exact timing of garbage collection is not predictable.\n- **Performance Overhead**: While GC improves memory management, it can introduce pauses (GC pauses) during collection, which may impact performance in real-time applications.\n\nBy leveraging garbage collection, C# developers can focus on application logic without worrying about low-level memory management, while still maintaining efficient and reliable applications.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `IDisposable` interface in C# is used to provide a mechanism for releasing unmanaged resources, such as file handles, database connections, or network sockets, that a class may hold. It is part of the `System` namespace and defines a single method:\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IDisposable\n{\n    void Dispose();\n}\n```\n\n### Purpose of `IDisposable`\nIn .NET, the garbage collector (GC) automatically manages the memory for managed objects. However, it does not handle unmanaged resources, which are resources outside the control of the .NET runtime, such as operating system resources. The `IDisposable` interface allows developers to explicitly release these unmanaged resources when they are no longer needed, ensuring efficient resource management and avoiding resource leaks.\n\n### How to Use `IDisposable`\n1. **Implementing `Dispose` Method**:\n   A class that holds unmanaged resources should implement the `IDisposable` interface and provide the logic to release those resources in the `Dispose` method.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable\n   {\n       private IntPtr unmanagedResource; // Example of an unmanaged resource\n\n       public void Dispose()\n       {\n           // Release unmanaged resources\n           if (unmanagedResource != IntPtr.Zero)\n           {\n               // Free the resource\n               unmanagedResource = IntPtr.Zero;\n           }\n\n           // Suppress finalization to optimize GC\n           GC.SuppressFinalize(this);\n       }\n\n       ~ResourceHolder()\n       {\n           // Finalizer as a fallback to release unmanaged resources\n           Dispose();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `using` Statement**:\n   The `using` statement ensures that the `Dispose` method is called automatically when the object goes out of scope, even if an exception occurs.\n\n   ```csharp\n   using (var resource = new ResourceHolder())\n   {\n       // Use the resource\n   } // Dispose is called automatically here\n   ```\n\n3. **Manual Disposal**:\n   If the `using` statement is not used, the `Dispose` method must be called explicitly.\n\n   ```csharp\n   var resource = new ResourceHolder();\n   try\n   {\n       // Use the resource\n   }\n   finally\n   {\n       resource.Dispose();\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always implement `IDisposable` for classes that use unmanaged resources.\n- Use the `using` statement whenever possible to ensure proper disposal.\n- Suppress finalization in the `Dispose` method using `GC.SuppressFinalize` to improve performance.\n- Implement a finalizer (`~ClassName`) only as a safety net for releasing unmanaged resources if `Dispose` is not called.\n\n### Summary\nThe `IDisposable` interface is critical for managing unmanaged resources in C#. It provides a standardized way to release these resources deterministically, ensuring better performance and resource management in applications.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming lies in how tasks are executed and how the program handles waiting for operations to complete:\n\n### Synchronous Programming\n- In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other.\n- The program waits for a task to complete before moving on to the next one.\n- If a task involves a time-consuming operation (e.g., file I/O, network requests), the program becomes blocked and cannot perform other work until the task finishes.\n- Example:\n  ```csharp\n  public void SynchronousMethod()\n  {\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Task started\");\n      Thread.Sleep(3000); // Simulates a blocking operation\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Task completed\");\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Asynchronous Programming\n- In asynchronous programming, tasks can run concurrently without blocking the main thread.\n- The program does not wait for a task to complete; instead, it continues executing other code while the task runs in the background.\n- This is achieved using constructs like `async` and `await`, or by working with `Task` objects.\n- Asynchronous programming improves responsiveness, especially in applications with UI or server-side operations.\n- Example:\n  ```csharp\n  public async Task AsynchronousMethod()\n  {\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Task started\");\n      await Task.Delay(3000); // Simulates a non-blocking operation\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Task completed\");\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Key Differences\n| Aspect                  | Synchronous Programming                 | Asynchronous Programming                 |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Execution               | Sequential                              | Concurrent                               |\n| Blocking                | Blocks the thread until task completes  | Does not block the thread                |\n| Performance             | Slower for I/O-bound or long-running tasks | More efficient for I/O-bound tasks       |\n| Use Case                | Simple, short-lived tasks               | Long-running or I/O-intensive tasks      |\n\nBy using asynchronous programming in C#, developers can create more efficient and responsive applications, particularly for scenarios involving I/O operations or tasks that take significant time to complete.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\n### Reflection in C#\n\nReflection in C# is a feature that allows the inspection of metadata about assemblies, modules, and types at runtime. It is part of the `System.Reflection` namespace and provides the ability to dynamically create instances of types, invoke methods, access fields and properties, and retrieve type information.\n\n#### Key Uses of Reflection:\n1. **Inspecting Metadata**: Reflection can be used to examine the structure of assemblies, classes, methods, properties, and other members at runtime.\n2. **Dynamic Type Creation**: It allows creating instances of types dynamically without knowing their type at compile time.\n3. **Invoking Methods Dynamically**: Methods can be invoked on objects dynamically, even if the method name is not known at compile time.\n4. **Accessing Private Members**: Reflection can access private fields, methods, and properties, though this should be done cautiously as it can break encapsulation.\n5. **Custom Attributes**: Reflection is often used to retrieve custom attributes applied to classes, methods, or other members.\n\n#### Common Classes in `System.Reflection`:\n- `Assembly`: Represents an assembly and provides methods to load and inspect it.\n- `Type`: Represents type declarations and provides methods to inspect and manipulate types.\n- `MethodInfo`: Represents a method and allows invocation of methods.\n- `PropertyInfo`: Represents a property and allows getting or setting property values.\n- `FieldInfo`: Represents a field and allows accessing field values.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Reflection;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Get the type of a class\n        Type type = typeof(SampleClass);\n\n        // Display type information\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Class Name: \" + type.Name);\n\n        // Get and display methods\n        MethodInfo[] methods = type.GetMethods();\n        foreach (var method in methods)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Method: \" + method.Name);\n        }\n\n        // Create an instance dynamically\n        object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);\n\n        // Invoke a method dynamically\n        MethodInfo methodInfo = type.GetMethod(\"SayHello\");\n        methodInfo.Invoke(instance, null);\n    }\n}\n\nclass SampleClass\n{\n    public void SayHello()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello from SampleClass!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Advantages of Reflection:\n- Enables dynamic behavior in applications.\n- Useful for frameworks, libraries, and tools that need to work with unknown types or assemblies.\n\n#### Disadvantages of Reflection:\n- **Performance Overhead**: Reflection is slower compared to direct code execution.\n- **Security Risks**: Accessing private members can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n- **Complexity**: Code using reflection can be harder to read and maintain.\n\nReflection is a powerful tool in C#, but it should be used judiciously to avoid performance and security issues.\n```",

            "question": "What are nullable types in C# and how are they used?",
            "answer": "```markdown\n### Nullable Types in C#\n\nIn C#, nullable types allow value types (e.g., `int`, `double`, `bool`, etc.) to represent `null` values in addition to their normal range of values. This is useful when dealing with scenarios where a value type might not have a value, such as database fields that can be null.\n\n#### Declaration of Nullable Types\nA nullable type is declared using the `?` syntax after the value type or by using the `Nullable<T>` generic type. For example:\n```csharp\nint? nullableInt = null; // Using the ? syntax\nNullable<int> anotherNullableInt = 5; // Using Nullable<T>\n```\n\n#### Checking for Null\nYou can check whether a nullable type has a value using the `HasValue` property or by comparing it to `null`:\n```csharp\nif (nullableInt.HasValue)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Value: {nullableInt.Value}\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Value is null\");\n}\n```\n\n#### Accessing the Value\nTo access the value of a nullable type, you can use the `Value` property. However, attempting to access `Value` when the nullable type is `null` will throw an exception. To avoid this, always check `HasValue` first.\n\n#### Null Coalescing Operator\nThe null coalescing operator (`??`) provides a way to specify a default value if the nullable type is `null`:\n```csharp\nint result = nullableInt ?? 0; // If nullableInt is null, result will be 0\n```\n\n#### Nullable Value Type with LINQ and Methods\nNullable types are particularly useful when working with LINQ queries or methods that may return null values. They allow you to handle optional or missing data more effectively.\n\n#### Example Usage\n```csharp\nint? age = null;\n\nif (age.HasValue)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Age: {age.Value}\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Age is not specified\");\n}\n\n// Using null coalescing operator\nint defaultAge = age ?? 18;\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Default Age: {defaultAge}\");\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n1. Nullable types are only applicable to value types.\n2. They are useful for representing optional or missing data.\n3. Always check for null using `HasValue` or the null coalescing operator to avoid runtime exceptions.\n\nBy using nullable types effectively, you can write safer and more robust code when dealing with scenarios where a value type might not always have a value.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `lock` statement in C# is used to ensure that a block of code is executed by only one thread at a time, providing thread safety in a multithreaded environment. It prevents multiple threads from accessing the same critical section of code simultaneously, which can lead to race conditions or inconsistent data.\n\nThe `lock` statement works by acquiring a mutual exclusion lock on a specified object (referred to as the lock object) before executing the code block. Once the code block is executed, the lock is automatically released. This ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time.\n\n### Syntax:\n```csharp\nlock (lockObject)\n{\n    // Critical section code\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Lock Object**: The object used in the `lock` statement should be a private or protected object to avoid unintended access by external code. Commonly, a private `readonly` object is used.\n2. **Thread Safety**: It helps prevent data corruption or unexpected behavior in shared resources when accessed by multiple threads.\n3. **Deadlock Prevention**: Care should be taken to avoid deadlocks by ensuring that locks are acquired in a consistent order across threads.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\nprivate readonly object _lockObject = new object();\nprivate int _counter = 0;\n\npublic void IncrementCounter()\n{\n    lock (_lockObject)\n    {\n        _counter++;\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Counter: {_counter}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `lock` statement ensures that only one thread can increment the `_counter` variable at a time, preventing race conditions.\n\n### Notes:\n- Avoid locking on publicly accessible objects (e.g., `this` or `typeof(ClassName)`) as it can lead to unexpected behavior if external code also locks on the same object.\n- Use `Monitor` class for more advanced locking scenarios if needed, but `lock` is preferred for simplicity and readability.\n```",

            "question": "What is the difference between Task and Thread in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, both `Task` and `Thread` are used for asynchronous programming and concurrency, but they have significant differences in their purpose, abstraction level, and usage:\n\n### 1. **Abstraction Level**\n   - **Thread**: A `Thread` represents a low-level, operating system-managed thread of execution. It is a basic unit of CPU utilization and provides direct control over thread lifecycle and behavior.\n   - **Task**: A `Task` is a higher-level abstraction provided by the Task Parallel Library (TPL). It represents an asynchronous operation that may or may not run on a separate thread. Tasks are designed to simplify parallelism and concurrency.\n\n### 2. **Resource Management**\n   - **Thread**: Threads are expensive to create and manage because they are directly tied to the operating system's threading model. Each thread consumes a significant amount of memory and system resources.\n   - **Task**: Tasks are lightweight and managed by the .NET runtime. They use the thread pool, which efficiently reuses threads to minimize overhead.\n\n### 3. **Ease of Use**\n   - **Thread**: Using threads requires manual management of synchronization, thread creation, and lifecycle. This can lead to complex and error-prone code.\n   - **Task**: Tasks simplify asynchronous programming by providing built-in support for continuations, cancellation, and exception handling. The `async` and `await` keywords make working with tasks more intuitive.\n\n### 4. **Concurrency vs. Parallelism**\n   - **Thread**: Threads are primarily used for parallelism, where multiple threads execute code simultaneously.\n   - **Task**: Tasks are designed for both concurrency (asynchronous operations) and parallelism. A task does not necessarily run on a separate thread; it may execute synchronously or asynchronously depending on the context.\n\n### 5. **Thread Pool Usage**\n   - **Thread**: A `Thread` does not use the thread pool by default. Each thread is independent and not reused.\n   - **Task**: Tasks typically use the thread pool, which manages and reuses threads efficiently.\n\n### 6. **Cancellation and Continuations**\n   - **Thread**: Threads do not have built-in support for cancellation or continuations. These must be implemented manually.\n   - **Task**: Tasks support cancellation via `CancellationToken` and continuations using methods like `ContinueWith` or the `await` keyword.\n\n### 7. **Error Handling**\n   - **Thread**: Exceptions in threads must be handled manually, and unhandled exceptions can terminate the application.\n   - **Task**: Tasks provide built-in exception handling and aggregation. Exceptions are encapsulated in the `AggregateException` and can be handled more gracefully.\n\n### Example:\n#### Using Thread:\n```csharp\nThread thread = new Thread(() =>\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Thread is running\");\n});\nthread.Start();\nthread.Join();\n```\n\n#### Using Task:\n```csharp\nTask task = Task.Run(() =>\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Task is running\");\n});\ntask.Wait();\n```\n\n### Summary:\n- Use `Thread` when you need fine-grained control over threading.\n- Use `Task` for most asynchronous and parallel programming scenarios, as it is higher-level, more efficient, and easier to use.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `yield` keyword in C# is used to simplify the implementation of iterators, which are methods, properties, or indexers that return sequences of values. It allows you to produce elements of a sequence one at a time, without the need to create a temporary collection or explicitly implement the `IEnumerator` or `IEnumerable` interfaces.\n\nWhen the `yield` keyword is used in a method, the method becomes an iterator. The `yield return` statement is used to return each element of the sequence, and the state of the method is preserved between calls, enabling the method to resume execution where it left off. The `yield break` statement is used to terminate the iteration.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Deferred Execution**: The `yield` keyword enables deferred execution, meaning the sequence is not evaluated until it is iterated over.\n2. **Simplifies Code**: It eliminates the need for manually managing the state of the iteration or creating temporary collections.\n3. **State Preservation**: The compiler automatically generates the necessary state machine to preserve the state of the method between iterations.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        foreach (int number in GetNumbers())\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(number);\n        }\n    }\n\n    static IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()\n    {\n        yield return 1;\n        yield return 2;\n        yield return 3;\n        yield break; // Ends the iteration\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nIn this example, the `GetNumbers` method uses `yield return` to return each number in the sequence. The iteration stops when `yield break` is encountered or when all `yield return` statements are executed.\n\nThe `yield` keyword is particularly useful for creating custom iterators and working with large datasets, as it avoids the overhead of creating and storing large collections in memory.\n```",

It is defined in the `System.Collections` namespace.\n   - **IQueryable**: Inherits from `IEnumerable` and is used to execute queries against a specific data source. It is defined in the `System.Linq` namespace.\n\n#### 2. **Execution**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Executes the query on the client side. The entire data is loaded into memory, and the filtering is done in-memory.\n   - **IQueryable**: Executes the query on the server side (e.g., database). The filtering is translated into a query language (like SQL) and executed on the data source.\n\n#### 3. **Use Case**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Suitable for in-memory collections like arrays, lists, or other data structures.\n   - **IQueryable**: Suitable for querying remote data sources like databases using LINQ-to-SQL or Entity Framework.\n\n#### 4. **Deferred Execution**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Supports deferred execution, but the query is executed in-memory.\n   - **IQueryable**: Also supports deferred execution, but the query is executed on the data source.\n\n#### 5. **Performance**\n   - **IEnumerable**: Less efficient for large datasets because it fetches all data into memory before processing.\n   - **IQueryable**: More efficient for large datasets as it fetches only the required data from the data source.\n\n#### 6. **Query Translation**\n   - **IEnumerable**: LINQ queries are executed in-memory and cannot be translated to a query language like SQL.\n   - **IQueryable**: LINQ queries are translated into the query language of the underlying data source (e.g., SQL for databases).\n\n#### 7. **Example**\n\n   - **IEnumerable Example**:\n     ```csharp\n     List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n     IEnumerable<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0); // Filtering happens in-memory\n     foreach (var num in evenNumbers)\n     {\n         Console.WriteLine(num);\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **IQueryable Example**:\n     ```csharp\n     using (var context = new MyDbContext())\n     {\n         IQueryable<User> users = context.Users.Where(u => u.IsActive); // Filtering happens in the database\n         foreach (var user in users)\n         {\n             Console.WriteLine(user.Name);\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n#### 8. **Key Points**\n   - Use `IEnumerable` for in-memory collections.\n   - Use `IQueryable` for querying remote data sources to leverage server-side processing and improve performance.\n```\n",

            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'base' keyword in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `base` keyword in C# is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class. It allows a derived class to call methods, access properties, or invoke constructors of its base class. This is particularly useful when you want to extend or modify the behavior of the base class while still utilizing its functionality.\n\n### Common Use Cases of `base`:\n1. **Calling a Base Class Constructor**:\n   You can use `base` to explicitly call a constructor of the base class from a derived class constructor.\n   ```csharp\n   public class BaseClass\n   {\n       public BaseClass(string message)\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(message);\n       }\n   }\n\n   public class DerivedClass : BaseClass\n   {\n       public DerivedClass() : base(\"Hello from BaseClass!\")\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Hello from DerivedClass!\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Accessing Base Class Methods or Properties**:\n   You can use `base` to call a method or access a property in the base class that has been overridden in the derived class.\n   ```csharp\n   public class BaseClass\n   {\n       public virtual void Display()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Display method in BaseClass\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   public class DerivedClass : BaseClass\n   {\n       public override void Display()\n       {\n           base.Display(); // Calls the base class method\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Display method in DerivedClass\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Accessing Hidden Members**:\n   If a derived class hides a member of the base class (using the `new` keyword), you can use `base` to access the hidden member.\n   ```csharp\n   public class BaseClass\n   {\n       public void Show()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Show method in BaseClass\");\n       }\n   }\n\n   public class DerivedClass : BaseClass\n   {\n       public new void Show()\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Show method in DerivedClass\");\n       }\n\n       public void CallBaseShow()\n       {\n           base.Show(); // Calls the base class method\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Key Points:\n- The `base` keyword is only valid in a derived class.\n- It is commonly used in scenarios involving inheritance to ensure proper interaction between the derived and base classes.\n- Using `base` helps avoid redundancy and leverages the functionality of the base class.\n\nBy using `base`, you can maintain a clear and structured relationship between base and derived classes, ensuring code reusability and clarity.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, **boxing** and **unboxing** are processes used to convert value types and reference types.\n\n### Boxing\nBoxing is the process of converting a value type (e.g., `int`, `float`) into a reference type (i.e., an object). When a value type is boxed, it is wrapped inside a `System.Object` or an interface type, and stored on the managed heap.\n\n#### Example:\n```csharp\nint num = 42; // Value type\nobject boxedNum = num; // Boxing\n```\n\n### Unboxing\nUnboxing is the reverse process of boxing. It converts a reference type (an object) back into a value type. This requires explicit casting and the object being unboxed must be of the correct value type.\n\n#### Example:\n```csharp\nobject boxedNum = 42; // Boxing\nint num = (int)boxedNum; // Unboxing\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Boxing is implicit, while unboxing requires explicit casting.\n- Boxing involves copying the value type data into the heap, which can have performance implications.\n- Unboxing retrieves the value type from the heap and copies it back to the stack.\n\nUnderstanding boxing and unboxing is important for performance optimization, as excessive boxing/unboxing can lead to memory and CPU overhead.\n```",

            "question": "What is the difference between stack and heap memory in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, stack and heap are two types of memory used for storing data during the execution of a program. The key differences between stack and heap memory are:\n\n### 1. **Storage Type**\n   - **Stack**: Stores value types and method call information, including local variables and method parameters. Data stored in the stack is of fixed size and is automatically managed.\n   - **Heap**: Stores reference types (e.g., objects, arrays) and dynamically allocated memory. The heap is used for data that needs to persist beyond the scope of a single method.\n\n### 2. **Memory Allocation**\n   - **Stack**: Memory is allocated and deallocated automatically in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner. Each method call creates a new stack frame, and when the method ends, the stack frame is removed.\n   - **Heap**: Memory is allocated dynamically, and the garbage collector is responsible for deallocating memory that is no longer in use.\n\n### 3. **Performance**\n   - **Stack**: Faster access because memory allocation and deallocation follow a predictable pattern (LIFO).\n   - **Heap**: Slower access due to the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and garbage collection.\n\n### 4. **Lifetime**\n   - **Stack**: Data exists only while the method in which it was created is executing. Once the method exits, the data is removed.\n   - **Heap**: Data exists until it is explicitly deallocated or garbage collected, making it suitable for objects that need to persist beyond the scope of a single method.\n\n### 5. **Thread Safety**\n   - **Stack**: Each thread has its own stack, so it is inherently thread-safe.\n   - **Heap**: Shared across threads, so synchronization is required to ensure thread safety when accessing heap memory.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\nvoid Example() \n{\n    int x = 10; // Stored in the stack (value type)\n    Person person = new Person(); // 'person' reference is on the stack, but the object is on the heap\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `x` is a value type and is stored in the stack.\n- The `person` variable (reference) is stored in the stack, but the actual `Person` object is allocated on the heap.\n\n### Summary:\n- Use the **stack** for small, short-lived data (e.g., local variables, method parameters).\n- Use the **heap** for larger, more complex objects that need to persist beyond a single method call.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, both `String` and `StringBuilder` are used to work with text, but they have significant differences in terms of mutability, performance, and use cases:\n\n### 1. **Mutability**\n   - **String**: Strings in C# are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string (e.g., concatenation, replacement) actually creates a new string object in memory.\n   - **StringBuilder**: StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it allows modifications to the same object without creating a new one. This makes it more efficient for scenarios where frequent modifications to text are required.\n\n### 2. **Performance**\n   - **String**: Since strings are immutable, operations like concatenation or appending involve creating new string objects, which can be costly in terms of memory and performance, especially in loops or when working with large amounts of text.\n   - **StringBuilder**: StringBuilder is optimized for performance when performing multiple string manipulations. It avoids creating new objects by modifying the existing buffer, making it faster and more memory-efficient for such tasks.\n\n### 3. **Use Cases**\n   - **String**: Best suited for scenarios where the text is not expected to change frequently, or when working with small, simple text manipulations.\n   - **StringBuilder**: Ideal for scenarios involving frequent or complex modifications to text, such as building large strings dynamically or performing multiple concatenation operations in loops.\n\n### 4. **Namespace**\n   - **String**: Belongs to the `System` namespace.\n   - **StringBuilder**: Belongs to the `System.Text` namespace.\n\n### Example:\n```csharp\n// Using String\nstring str = \"Hello\";\nstr += \" World\"; // Creates a new string object\nConsole.WriteLine(str); // Output: Hello World\n\n// Using StringBuilder\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(\"Hello\");\nsb.Append(\" World\"); // Modifies the existing object\nConsole.WriteLine(sb.ToString()); // Output: Hello World\n```\n\n### Summary:\n- Use `String` for simple, infrequent text manipulations.\n- Use `StringBuilder` for complex or repetitive string operations to improve performance and reduce memory overhead.\n```",

If an overflow occurs in an `unchecked` context, the result wraps around without throwing an exception. This is the default behavior in C# unless the compiler or runtime is explicitly configured to check for overflows.\n\n#### Example:\n```csharp\nint max = int.MaxValue;\nint result = unchecked(max + 1); // No exception, result wraps around\nConsole.WriteLine(result); // Output: -2147483648\n```\n\n### Use Cases\n- Use `checked` when you need to ensure the integrity of calculations and want to detect overflow errors.\n- Use `unchecked` when performance is critical, and you are confident that overflow will not cause issues or is acceptable.\n\n### Notes\n- The default behavior for overflow checking can be configured using compiler options (e.g., `/checked`).\n- The `checked` and `unchecked` keywords can be applied to specific expressions or entire blocks of code.\n\n#### Example of Block Usage:\n```csharp\nchecked\n{\n    int result = max + 1; // OverflowException will be thrown\n}\n\nunchecked\n{\n    int result = max + 1; // Overflow is ignored\n}\n```\n```",

For example, an `int[]` can only store integers.\n   - **ArrayList**: It is not type-safe and can store elements of any type because it stores objects as `object`. This can lead to runtime errors if typecasting is done incorrectly.\n\n### 2. **Performance**\n   - **Array**: Since it is type-safe, there is no need for boxing/unboxing, making it faster and more efficient.\n   - **ArrayList**: When storing value types, boxing/unboxing occurs, which can degrade performance.\n\n### 3. **Size**\n   - **Array**: Its size is fixed at the time of creation and cannot be changed.\n   - **ArrayList**: It is dynamic and can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.\n\n### 4. **Namespace**\n   - **Array**: It is part of the `System` namespace.\n   - **ArrayList**: It is part of the `System.Collections` namespace.\n\n### 5. **Generic Alternative**\n   - **Array**: There is no direct generic alternative because arrays are inherently type-safe.\n   - **ArrayList**: The generic alternative is `List<T>` from the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace, which is type-safe and preferred over `ArrayList` in modern C#.\n\n### Example\n```csharp\n// Array\nint[] numbers = new int[3] { 1, 2, 3 }; // Fixed size and type-safe\n\n// ArrayList\nArrayList list = new ArrayList();\nlist.Add(1); // Adding an integer\nlist.Add(\"Hello\"); // Adding a string (not type-safe)\n```\n\n### Summary\n- Use `Array` when you need a fixed-size, type-safe collection.\n- Use `ArrayList` only if you need a dynamic collection and are working with older versions of C#. For modern C#, prefer `List<T>` for a dynamic, type-safe collection.\n```",

            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `default` keyword in C# serves multiple purposes depending on the context in which it is used:\n\n1. **Default Value of a Type**: It is used to produce the default value for a given type. For example:\n   - For value types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`), it returns `0`, `0.0`, or `false` respectively.\n   - For reference types (e.g., `string`, `object`), it returns `null`.\n   - For nullable types, it returns `null`.\n\n   Example:\n   ```csharp\n   int defaultValue = default(int); // 0\n   string defaultString = default(string); // null\n   ```\n\n2. **Switch Statement**: In a `switch` statement, the `default` keyword is used to define a case that will execute if no other case matches. It acts as a fallback.\n\n   Example:\n   ```csharp\n   int number = 5;\n   switch (number)\n   {\n       case 1:\n           Console.WriteLine(\"One\");\n           break;\n       case 2:\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Two\");\n           break;\n       default:\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Default case\");\n           break;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Default Literal (C# 7.1 and later)**: The `default` keyword can be used as a literal to simplify code. Instead of specifying the type explicitly, you can use `default` directly.\n\n   Example:\n   ```csharp\n   int defaultValue = default; // 0\n   string defaultString = default; // null\n   ```\n\n4. **Generic Constraints**: When working with generics, the `default` keyword can be used to initialize variables to their default value, especially when the type is unknown.\n\n   Example:\n   ```csharp\n   public T GetDefaultValue<T>()\n   {\n       return default(T);\n   }\n   ```\n\nIn summary, the `default` keyword is a versatile feature in C# that simplifies working with default values, provides a fallback in switch statements, and enhances code readability in various scenarios.\n```",

This can lead to runtime errors if the operation is invalid for the actual type.\n- **Usage**: Useful when working with objects that are not known at compile time, such as COM objects, reflection, or dynamic programming scenarios.\n- **Example**:\n  ```csharp\n  dynamic obj = 10; // Initially an int\n  obj = \"Hello\"; // Now a string\n  ```\n\n### Key Differences\n| Feature                | `var`                          | `dynamic`                      |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Type Resolution**    | At compile time                | At runtime                     |\n| **Type Checking**      | Performed at compile time      | Performed at runtime           |\n| **Type Mutability**    | Fixed after initialization     | Can change during execution    |\n| **Error Detection**    | Compile-time errors for invalid operations | Runtime errors for invalid operations |\n| **Use Case**           | When the type is known or can be inferred | When the type is not known at compile time |\n\n### Example Comparison\n```csharp\n// Using var\nvar number = 10; // Inferred as int\nnumber = \"Hello\"; // Compile-time error: Cannot assign string to int\n\n// Using dynamic\ndynamic obj = 10; // Initially an int\nobj = \"Hello\"; // No error at compile time, but type changes at runtime\n```\n\n### Summary\n- Use `var` when the type is known or can be inferred and you want compile-time type safety.\n- Use `dynamic` when the type is not known at compile time or when working with dynamic scenarios, but be cautious of potential runtime errors.\n```",

            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'nameof' operator in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nThe `nameof` operator in C# is used to obtain the name of a variable, type, or member as a string. It is particularly useful for avoiding hardcoding strings in your code, which improves maintainability and reduces the risk of errors when renaming elements.\n\n### Key Purposes of `nameof`:\n1. **Refactoring Safety**: When you rename a variable, type, or member, the `nameof` operator ensures the string representation is updated automatically during refactoring.\n2. **Improved Readability**: It makes the code more readable and self-explanatory compared to hardcoded strings.\n3. **Error Prevention**: Reduces the likelihood of typos or mismatches in string literals.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```csharp\nclass Example\n{\n    public string PropertyName { get; set; }\n\n    public void ShowName()\n    {\n        // Using nameof to get the property name as a string\n        Console.WriteLine(nameof(PropertyName)); // Output: \"PropertyName\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Use Cases:\n1. **Argument Validation**:\n   ```csharp\n   void ValidateInput(string input)\n   {\n       if (input == null)\n           throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n   }\n   ```\n2. **Logging**:\n   ```csharp\n   Console.WriteLine($\"Error in method: {nameof(ValidateInput)}\");\n   ```\n3. **Binding Frameworks**:\n   ```csharp\n   NotifyPropertyChanged(nameof(PropertyName));\n   ```\n\nBy using `nameof`, you ensure your code remains robust and easier to maintain, especially in large projects.\n```",

            "question": "What is the difference between 'finalize' and 'dispose' in C#?",
            "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, `finalize` and `dispose` are both used for resource management, but they serve different purposes and are implemented differently:\n\n### Finalize\n- **Purpose**: The `finalize` method is used to release unmanaged resources before the object is reclaimed by the garbage collector.\n- **Implementation**: It is implemented by overriding the `Finalize` method in a class. This is done by defining a destructor in C# (e.g., `~ClassName()`).\n- **Invocation**: The garbage collector automatically calls the `Finalize` method when it determines that the object is no longer accessible.\n- **Performance**: Finalization can be slow because it relies on the garbage collector and requires an additional pass to clean up finalized objects.\n- **Control**: You have no direct control over when the `Finalize` method is called.\n- **Usage**: Typically used as a safety net for cleaning up unmanaged resources if `Dispose` was not called.\n\n### Dispose\n- **Purpose**: The `Dispose` method is used to explicitly release unmanaged resources and perform cleanup in a deterministic manner.\n- **Implementation**: It is part of the `IDisposable` interface, which a class implements to provide the `Dispose` method.\n- **Invocation**: The `Dispose` method must be called explicitly in code or indirectly via a `using` statement.\n- **Performance**: More efficient than `Finalize` because it allows for immediate cleanup of resources without waiting for garbage collection.\n- **Control**: You have full control over when the `Dispose` method is called.\n- **Usage**: Commonly used for releasing unmanaged resources like file handles, database connections, or network sockets.\n\n### Key Differences\n| Feature              | Finalize                          | Dispose                           |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Purpose**          | Cleanup during garbage collection | Explicit cleanup of resources     |\n| **Implementation**   | Destructor (`~ClassName`)         | `IDisposable.Dispose` method      |\n| **Invocation**       | Automatic by garbage collector    | Manual or via `using` statement   |\n| **Performance**      | Slower (depends on GC)            | Faster (deterministic)            |\n| **Control**          | No direct control                | Full control                      |\n| **Usage**            | Safety net for unmanaged cleanup | Deterministic resource cleanup    |\n\n### Best Practices\n- Always implement `IDisposable` and use the `Dispose` method for deterministic cleanup of resources.\n- Use a `using` statement to ensure `Dispose` is called automatically.\n- Implement a finalizer (`Finalize`) only if your class uses unmanaged resources directly and as a fallback in case `Dispose` is not called.\n- If both `Dispose` and `Finalize` are implemented, ensure `Dispose` suppresses finalization using `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` to avoid redundant cleanup.\n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively manage resources and improve application performance.\n```",
