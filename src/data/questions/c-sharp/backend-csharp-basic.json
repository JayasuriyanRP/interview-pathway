        "answer": "```markdown ### How Does Garbage Collection Work in .NET?\n\nGarbage Collection (GC) in .NET is an automatic memory management feature that helps developers avoid memory leaks and manual memory deallocation. Here’s how it works:\n\n#### 1. **Managed Heap**\n- .NET allocates memory for objects on the managed heap.\n- When objects are no longer referenced, they become eligible for garbage collection.\n\n#### 2. **Generations**\n- The managed heap is divided into three generations:\n  - **Generation 0:** Short-lived objects (e.g., temporary variables).\n  - **Generation 1:** Objects that survived one GC cycle.\n  - **Generation 2:** Long-lived objects (e.g., static data, application-wide caches).\n- New objects are allocated in Generation 0. If they survive a collection, they are promoted to higher generations.\n\n#### 3. **Garbage Collection Process**\n- The GC periodically checks for objects that are no longer accessible by any references in the code.\n- When memory is low or the heap gets full, the GC runs to reclaim memory.\n- The process involves:\n  1. **Marking:** Identifying which objects are still in use.\n  2. **Sweeping:** Reclaiming memory used by unreferenced objects.\n  3. **Compacting:** Rearranging the remaining objects to make the heap contiguous, reducing fragmentation.\n\n#### 4. **Finalization and IDisposable**\n- If an object has a finalizer (`~ClassName()`), the GC calls it before reclaiming the memory.\n- For deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources, implement `IDisposable` and use the `Dispose()` method.\n\n#### 5. **Differences in .NET Framework vs .NET Core**\n- Both use similar GC concepts, but .NET Core has a more optimized and configurable GC.\n- .NET Core supports server and workstation GC modes, and can be tuned for high-performance scenarios.\n\n#### 6. **Manual GC Control**\n- You can force a collection with `GC.Collect()`, but it’s generally discouraged unless necessary.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nGarbage collection in .NET automatically manages memory by tracking object references, reclaiming unused memory, and optimizing heap usage, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than manual memory management.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Dependency Injection in .NET Core\n\n**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. In .NET Core, DI is a first-class citizen and is built into the framework, making it easy to manage dependencies throughout your application.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n\n- **Dependency**: An object that another object depends on.\n- **Injection**: The process of providing an object with its dependencies.\n\n#### How DI Works in .NET Core\n\n1. **Service Registration**: Dependencies (services) are registered in the `IServiceCollection` within the `Startup.cs` file, typically in the `ConfigureServices` method.\n2. **Service Lifetime**: Services can be registered with different lifetimes:\n   - `Singleton`: One instance for the entire application.\n   - `Scoped`: One instance per request.\n   - `Transient`: A new instance every time it is requested.\n3. **Service Resolution**: The .NET Core runtime automatically injects the required dependencies into constructors of classes (like controllers or services) when they are needed.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Service Interface\npublic interface IMessageService\n{\n    string GetMessage();\n}\n\n// Service Implementation\npublic class MessageService : IMessageService\n{\n    public string GetMessage() => \"Hello from DI!\";\n}\n\n// Registering the service in Startup.cs\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.AddTransient<IMessageService, MessageService>();\n}\n\n// Using the service in a controller\npublic class HomeController : Controller\n{\n    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;\n\n    public HomeController(IMessageService messageService)\n    {\n        _messageService = messageService;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        var message = _messageService.GetMessage();\n        return View(\"Index\", message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Loose Coupling**: Classes depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.\n- **Easier Testing**: Dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced.\n- **Centralized Configuration**: All dependencies are configured in one place.\n\n#### Summary\n\nDependency Injection in .NET Core simplifies the management of dependencies, promotes best practices like loose coupling, and is seamlessly integrated into the framework, making it easy to use in web applications, APIs, and other .NET Core projects.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n## How to Perform Unit Testing in .NET Core\n\nUnit testing in .NET Core is straightforward and well-supported. Here’s how you can perform unit testing:\n\n### 1. Choose a Testing Framework\n\nThe most popular frameworks for unit testing in .NET Core are:\n- **xUnit** (default for .NET Core)\n- **NUnit**\n- **MSTest**\n\nxUnit is commonly used due to its integration with .NET Core CLI and Visual Studio.\n\n### 2. Create a Test Project\n\nYou can create a test project using the .NET CLI:\n\n```bash\ndotnet new xunit -n MyProject.Tests\n```\n\nThis creates a new xUnit test project. Add a reference to the project you want to test:\n\n```bash\ncd MyProject.Tests\ndotnet add reference ../MyProject/MyProject.csproj\n```\n\n### 3. Write Unit Tests\n\nCreate test classes and methods. For example, using xUnit:\n\n```csharp\nusing Xunit;\nusing MyProject;\n\npublic class CalculatorTests\n{\n    [Fact]\n    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()\n    {\n        var calculator = new Calculator();\n        var result = calculator.Add(2, 3);\n        Assert.Equal(5, result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `[Fact]` denotes a test method.\n- `Assert.Equal` checks if the result matches the expected value.\n\n### 4. Run the Tests\n\nYou can run tests using the .NET CLI:\n\n```bash\ndotnet test\n```\n\nThis command builds the test project and executes all tests, displaying the results in the console.\n\n### 5. View Results\n\nTest results will be displayed in the terminal or in the Test Explorer if using Visual Studio.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Create a test project (e.g., with xUnit).\n- Reference your main project.\n- Write test methods using assertions.\n- Run tests with `dotnet test`.\n\nUnit testing in .NET Core is efficient and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and various IDEs.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ### How Cross-Platform Development Works in .NET Core\n\n.NET Core is designed from the ground up to be **cross-platform**, enabling developers to build and run applications on multiple operating systems, including **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. Here’s how cross-platform development is achieved in .NET Core:\n\n#### 1. Platform-Agnostic Runtime\n\n- **.NET Core Runtime** is available for all major operating systems.\n- Applications target the .NET Standard or .NET Core APIs, which are implemented consistently across platforms.\n\n#### 2. Modular and Open Source\n\n- .NET Core is **modular**, allowing developers to include only the necessary libraries.\n- Being **open source**, it receives community contributions and support for various platforms.\n\n#### 3. Development Tools\n\n- Tools like **Visual Studio Code**, **Visual Studio**, and the **.NET CLI** (`dotnet`) are available on all supported platforms.\n- Developers can write, build, test, and deploy applications from any OS.\n\n#### 4. Platform-Specific Implementations\n\n- When platform-specific functionality is needed (e.g., file system access, OS APIs), .NET Core provides abstractions or conditional compilation using preprocessor directives.\n- NuGet packages can provide platform-specific implementations.\n\n#### 5. Deployment Models\n\n- **Framework-Dependent Deployment**: The app relies on a shared system-wide .NET Core runtime.\n- **Self-Contained Deployment**: The app includes its own copy of the .NET Core runtime, ensuring it runs the same way on any supported OS.\n\n#### 6. Consistent APIs\n\n- .NET Core implements a large subset of APIs from the .NET Standard, ensuring code compatibility across platforms.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n.NET Core enables cross-platform development by providing a consistent runtime, APIs, and tooling across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Developers can build applications once and deploy them anywhere .NET Core is supported, with minimal or no code changes.",

        "question": "Explain middleware in ASP.NET Core.",
        "answer": "```markdown ### Middleware in ASP.NET Core\n\nMiddleware in **ASP.NET Core** refers to software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component in the pipeline has the opportunity to:\n\n- Process incoming HTTP requests.\n- Decide whether to pass the request to the next middleware.\n- Perform actions before and after the next component in the pipeline.\n\n#### How Middleware Works\n\nWhen an HTTP request arrives at the application, it is passed through a sequence of middleware components. Each component can:\n\n- **Perform operations** on the request (e.g., authentication, logging).\n- **Short-circuit** the pipeline and generate a response (e.g., return a 404 error).\n- **Call the next middleware** in the pipeline.\n\n#### Example Middleware Pipeline\n\n```csharp\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\n{\n    app.UseMiddleware<FirstMiddleware>();\n    app.UseMiddleware<SecondMiddleware>();\n    app.UseMiddleware<ThirdMiddleware>();\n}\n```\n\nThe request flows through `FirstMiddleware`, then `SecondMiddleware`, and finally `ThirdMiddleware`.\n\n#### Built-in Middleware Examples\n\n- **Authentication**\n- **Authorization**\n- **Static Files**\n- **Routing**\n- **Exception Handling**\n\n#### Custom Middleware Example\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomMiddleware\n{\n    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;\n\n    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)\n    {\n        _next = next;\n    }\n\n    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)\n    {\n        // Do something before\n        await context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Before\\n\");\n\n        await _next(context); // Call the next middleware\n\n        // Do something after\n        await context.Response.WriteAsync(\"After\\n\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo use this middleware:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- Middleware are executed in the order they are added.\n- Each middleware can modify the request and response.\n- Middleware enables a modular and flexible way to handle cross-cutting concerns.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nMiddleware in ASP.NET Core is a fundamental concept for building the HTTP request processing pipeline, allowing developers to compose application behavior in a modular and reusable way.",

        "answer": "```markdown\nIn .NET Core applications, configuration is managed using a flexible and extensible system provided by the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration namespace. Here’s how configuration is typically handled:\n\n### 1. Configuration Sources\n.NET Core supports multiple configuration sources out of the box, such as:\n- `appsettings.json` (and environment-specific files like `appsettings.Development.json`)\n- Environment variables\n- Command-line arguments\n- User secrets (for development)\n- Custom providers (e.g., Azure Key Vault, INI, XML files)\n\n### 2. Configuration Loading\nConfiguration is usually set up in the `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` file using the `ConfigurationBuilder`. For example:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()\n    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())\n    .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)\n    .AddEnvironmentVariables();\n\nIConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();\n```\n\nIn ASP.NET Core, this is handled automatically, and you can inject `IConfiguration` wherever needed.\n\n### 3. Accessing Configuration\nYou can access configuration values directly:\n\n```csharp\nstring myValue = configuration[\"MyKey\"];\n```\n\nOr bind configuration sections to strongly-typed objects:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MySettings\n{\n    public string Setting1 { get; set; }\n    public int Setting2 { get; set; }\n}\n\n// In Startup.cs or Program.cs\nservices.Configure<MySettings>(configuration.GetSection(\"MySettings\"));\n```\n\nThen inject `IOptions<MySettings>` into your classes.\n\n### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration\n.NET Core supports environment-based configuration. For example, `appsettings.Development.json` will override values in `appsettings.json` when the environment is set to Development.\n\n### 5. Reloading Configuration\nIf `reloadOnChange` is set to `true` in `AddJsonFile`, changes to the configuration file will be picked up automatically at runtime.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n.NET Core uses a provider-based configuration system that supports multiple sources, environment-specific settings, and strongly-typed binding, making configuration management flexible and powerful.\n```\n",

        "question": "How does logging work in .NET Core?",
        "answer": "```markdown\nIn .NET Core, logging is built around a flexible and extensible framework provided by the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` namespace. Here’s how logging works in .NET Core:\n\n### 1. Logging Abstraction\n\n.NET Core provides an abstraction for logging through the `ILogger` and `ILogger<T>` interfaces. This allows developers to write logging code that is independent of the underlying logging implementation.\n\n### 2. Built-in Providers\n\n.NET Core includes several built-in logging providers, such as:\n- **Console** (logs to the console)\n- **Debug** (logs to the debug output window)\n- **EventSource**\n- **EventLog** (Windows only)\n- **Azure App Services**, etc.\n\nYou can also use third-party providers like Serilog, NLog, or log4net.\n\n### 3. Configuration\n\nLogging is typically configured in the `Program.cs` or `appsettings.json` file. You can specify log levels, filters, and providers.\n\n**Example (appsettings.json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"Logging\": {\n    \"LogLevel\": {\n      \"Default\": \"Information\",\n      \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\",\n      \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Dependency Injection\n\nLogging services are registered with the dependency injection (DI) container by default. You can inject `ILogger<T>` into your classes:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyService\n{\n    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;\n\n    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public void DoWork()\n    {\n        _logger.LogInformation(\"Doing work...\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Usage\n\nYou can log messages at different severity levels:\n- `LogTrace`\n- `LogDebug`\n- `LogInformation`\n- `LogWarning`\n- `LogError`\n- `LogCritical`\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\n_logger.LogWarning(\"This is a warning message.\");\n```\n\n### 6. Extensibility\n\nYou can create custom logging providers by implementing the `ILoggerProvider` and `ILogger` interfaces.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nLogging in .NET Core is highly configurable and provider-based, making it easy to direct log output to various destinations and control log verbosity via configuration. It is tightly integrated with dependency injection, promoting clean and testable code.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown\nIn .NET Core projects, dependency versioning is primarily managed through the project file (`.csproj`) using the NuGet package manager. Here’s how you handle dependency versioning:\n\n### 1. Specify Versions in `.csproj`\nYou define dependencies and their versions directly in your `.csproj` file:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"13.0.1\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nYou can specify:\n- **Exact version**: `Version=\"1.2.3\"`\n- **Minimum version**: `Version=\"1.2.3\"` (NuGet will use 1.2.3 or higher, unless restricted)\n- **Version ranges**: `Version=\"[1.2.3,2.0.0)\"` (1.2.3 up to, but not including, 2.0.0)\n\n### 2. Use of `global.json`\nFor SDK versioning, you can use a `global.json` file to pin the .NET SDK version for your project:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sdk\": {\n    \"version\": \"7.0.100\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Restore and Lock Files\n- **`dotnet restore`**: Ensures all dependencies are downloaded at the specified versions.\n- **Package lock files**: With NuGet 5.0+ and .NET Core 3.0+, you can enable a lock file (`packages.lock.json`) to lock down the exact versions used, ensuring repeatable builds.\n\n### 4. Central Package Management\nFor large solutions, you can use [Central Package Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/Central-Package-Management) to manage package versions in a single location.\n\n### 5. Handling Conflicts\nIf multiple dependencies require different versions of the same package, .NET Core uses the highest compatible version by default. You can use binding redirects in .NET Framework, but in .NET Core, this is handled by the runtime.\n\n### 6.

        "answer": "```markdown **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Programming in .NET**\n\nIn .NET, **synchronous** and **asynchronous** programming refer to how tasks are executed, especially when dealing with operations that may take time, such as I/O, network calls, or database access.\n\n---\n\n### Synchronous Programming\n\n- **Definition:** Tasks are executed one after another. Each operation must complete before the next one starts.\n- **Blocking:** The calling thread is blocked until the operation finishes.\n- **Example:**\n    ```csharp\n    // Synchronous file read\n    string content = File.ReadAllText(\"file.txt\");\n    Console.WriteLine(content); // This line waits until the file is read\n    ```\n- **Use Case:** Suitable for quick, simple operations where blocking the thread has minimal impact.\n\n---\n\n### Asynchronous Programming\n\n- **Definition:** Tasks can be executed without waiting for previous operations to complete. The calling thread can continue executing other code while waiting for the operation to finish.\n- **Non-blocking:** The calling thread is not blocked; instead, it can perform other work or return control to the caller.\n- **Keywords:** Uses `async` and `await` in C#.\n- **Example:**\n    ```csharp\n    // Asynchronous file read\n    string content = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(\"file.txt\");\n    Console.WriteLine(content); // This line runs after the file is read, but the thread was not blocked\n    ```\n- **Use Case:** Ideal for I/O-bound or long-running operations, especially in UI or web applications where responsiveness is important.\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences\n\n| Aspect            | Synchronous                                | Asynchronous                                  |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Thread Blocking   | Yes                                        | No                                            |\n| Responsiveness    | Lower (can freeze UI or block requests)     | Higher (UI remains responsive, better scaling)|\n| Complexity        | Simpler                                    | More complex (requires async/await handling)  |\n| Resource Usage    | Can tie up threads unnecessarily            | More efficient use of threads                 |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nSynchronous programming in .NET blocks the thread until a task completes, while asynchronous programming allows the thread to continue executing other tasks, improving responsiveness and scalability, especially for I/O-bound operations.",

        "question": "Explain the concept of reflection in .NET.",
        "answer": "```markdown **Reflection in .NET**\n\nReflection is a powerful feature in the .NET Framework and .NET Core that allows programs to inspect and interact with their own metadata at runtime. Using reflection, you can:\n\n- Discover information about assemblies, modules, types, and members (such as properties, methods, fields, and events).\n- Dynamically create instances of types.\n- Invoke methods or access fields and properties dynamically.\n- Access custom attributes applied to types and members.\n\n### Key Classes\n\nReflection functionality is provided primarily through the following namespaces and classes:\n\n- `System.Reflection` namespace\n- `Type` class (from `System` namespace)\n- `Assembly`, `MethodInfo`, `PropertyInfo`, `FieldInfo`, `ConstructorInfo`, etc.\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n- **Dynamic type discovery:** Loading assemblies and discovering types at runtime.\n- **Late binding:** Invoking methods or accessing properties without knowing them at compile time.\n- **Attribute inspection:** Reading custom attributes for configuration or metadata.\n- **Code generation and dynamic proxies:** Creating types or methods on the fly (e.g., using `System.Reflection.Emit`).\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Reflection;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public void SayHello() => Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, Reflection!\");\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Type type = typeof(Example);\n        MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod(\"SayHello\");\n        object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);\n        method.Invoke(instance, null); // Outputs: Hello, Reflection!\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Performance:** Reflection is slower than direct code access due to runtime type discovery and invocation.\n- **Security:** Reflection can access private members, so it should be used carefully.\n- **Cross-platform:** Reflection APIs are available in both .NET Framework and .NET Core, but some advanced features (like emitting IL) may differ.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nReflection in .NET enables runtime type inspection and dynamic invocation, making it essential for scenarios like serialization, dependency injection, and frameworks that require metadata-driven behavior.",

        "question": "How does Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation work in .NET?",
        "answer": "```markdown ### How Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation Works in .NET\n\nJust-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a core feature of the .NET execution model, both in the .NET Framework and .NET Core (now .NET 5/6+). Here’s an advanced overview of how it works:\n\n#### 1. Compilation to Intermediate Language (IL)\n- When you build a .NET application, your source code (C#, VB.NET, F#) is compiled by the language compiler into an Intermediate Language (IL), also known as Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).\n- This IL is platform-agnostic and stored in assemblies (.dll or .exe files).\n\n#### 2. Execution and the CLR\n- At runtime, the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) loads the IL code.\n- The CLR is responsible for memory management, security, and execution of .NET programs.\n\n#### 3. JIT Compilation Process\n- When a method is called for the first time, the CLR invokes the JIT compiler.\n- The JIT compiler translates the IL code of that method into native machine code specific to the underlying CPU architecture.\n- The native code is then executed directly by the processor.\n\n#### 4. Caching of Native Code\n- Once a method is JIT-compiled, the native code is cached in memory.\n- Subsequent calls to the same method use the already-compiled native code, avoiding recompilation overhead.\n\n#### 5. Types of JIT Compilers\n- **Standard JIT**: Compiles methods as they are called (default in .NET Framework).\n- **Pre-JIT (NGen)**: Ahead-of-time compilation using Native Image Generator (NGen) to produce native images at install time.\n- **Tiered Compilation**: Introduced in .NET Core, it starts with a quick, less-optimized compilation and recompiles hot methods with more optimizations as needed.\n\n#### 6. Advantages of JIT Compilation\n- **Platform Independence**: IL can run on any platform with a compatible CLR and JIT.\n- **Runtime Optimizations**: JIT can optimize code based on the actual runtime environment (CPU, OS, etc.).\n- **Security**: JIT compilation allows for runtime security checks and verifications.\n\n#### 7. Differences in .NET Core\n- .NET Core (and .NET 5/6+) introduced the **RyuJIT** compiler, which is faster and supports both x64 and ARM architectures.\n- .NET Core supports **ReadyToRun (R2R)** images, a form of ahead-of-time compilation for faster startup.\n\n---\n\n#### Summary Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[Source Code] --> B[IL Code (Assembly)]\n    B --> C[CLR Loads Assembly]\n    C --> D[JIT Compiler]\n    D --> E[Native Machine Code]\n    E --> F[Execution by CPU]\n    D -->|Caches| E\n```\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n- [Microsoft Docs: JIT Compilation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-execution-process)\n- [Microsoft Docs: RyuJIT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/run-time-config/jit-compilation)\n- [.NET Blog: Tiered Compilation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/tiered-compilation-preview-in-net-core-2-1/)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nJIT compilation in .NET converts IL code to native code at runtime, enabling platform independence, runtime optimizations, and efficient execution.

        "question": "What is Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation in .NET Core?",
        "answer": "```markdown ### Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation in .NET Core\n\n**Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation** is a process in .NET Core where the application's Intermediate Language (IL) code is compiled into native machine code *before* the application is run, rather than at runtime. This is in contrast to the traditional Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, where IL code is compiled to native code on the fly as the application executes.\n\n#### Key Points about AOT Compilation in .NET Core\n\n- **Performance:** AOT compilation can improve startup performance because the application does not need to spend time compiling IL to native code at runtime.\n- **Deployment:** Applications compiled with AOT can be deployed as self-contained executables, which include all necessary dependencies and native code, making them easier to distribute and run on target machines.\n- **Platform Support:** AOT is especially useful for platforms where JIT compilation is not allowed or is undesirable, such as iOS (due to security restrictions) or certain embedded environments.\n- **Size vs. Speed Tradeoff:** AOT-compiled binaries are often larger than their IL counterparts, but they can start faster and have more predictable performance characteristics.\n- **.NET Native and ReadyToRun:** In .NET Core, technologies like **ReadyToRun** and **Crossgen** (and in .NET 5+ with **crossgen2** and **NativeAOT**) are used for AOT compilation. ReadyToRun compiles IL to native code ahead of time, while still allowing some JIT compilation if needed.\n\n#### Example Workflow\n\n1. **Build Application:** You write your .NET Core application as usual.\n2. **AOT Compilation:** Use tools like `dotnet publish` with the `--self-contained` and `-p:PublishReadyToRun=true` options, or use NativeAOT for full AOT.\n3. **Deployment:** The output is a native executable that can be run directly on the target platform.\n\n#### Benefits of AOT in .NET Core\n\n- **Faster startup times**\n- **Reduced memory usage in some scenarios**\n- **Improved security (no JIT at runtime)**\n- **Better compatibility with restricted environments**\n\n#### Limitations\n\n- **Reflection and dynamic code generation** may be limited or unsupported.\n- **Larger binary sizes** due to native code inclusion.\n- **Some runtime optimizations** performed by the JIT may not be available.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nAOT compilation in .NET Core is a technique to pre-compile IL code to native code, improving startup performance and enabling deployment scenarios where JIT is not feasible. It is increasingly important in modern .NET (including .NET 5/6/7+) for building fast, portable, and secure applications.",

        "question": "How do you implement custom middleware in ASP.NET Core?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing Custom Middleware in ASP.NET Core\n\nIn ASP.NET Core, middleware are software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. You can implement custom middleware to add your own logic to this pipeline.\n\n#### Steps to Implement Custom Middleware\n\n1. **Create a Middleware Class**\n\n   A middleware class must include:\n   - A constructor that takes a `RequestDelegate` parameter.\n   - An `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method that takes an `HttpContext` parameter.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class CustomMiddleware\n   {\n       private readonly RequestDelegate _next;\n\n       public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)\n       {\n           _next = next;\n       }\n\n       public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)\n       {\n           // Custom logic before next middleware\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Custom Middleware: Before\");\n\n           await _next(context); // Call the next middleware\n\n           // Custom logic after next middleware\n           Console.WriteLine(\"Custom Middleware: After\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Register the Middleware in the Pipeline**\n\n   Use the `UseMiddleware<T>` extension method in the `Configure` method of `Startup.cs` (or in the builder in .NET 6+ minimal hosting):\n\n   ```csharp\n   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\n   {\n       app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();\n\n       // Other middlewares (e.g., routing, endpoints)\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Or, with minimal APIs in .NET 6+:\n\n   ```csharp\n   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n   var app = builder.Build();\n\n   app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();\n\n   app.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello World!\");\n\n   app.Run();\n   ```\n\n3. **(Optional) Use Extension Method for Cleaner Syntax**\n\n   You can create an extension method for easier registration:\n\n   ```csharp\n   public static class CustomMiddlewareExtensions\n   {\n       public static IApplicationBuilder UseCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)\n       {\n           return builder.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Then register it as:\n\n   ```csharp\n   app.UseCustomMiddleware();\n   ```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- Middleware can perform actions before and after calling the next middleware.\n- Middleware must call `_next(context)` to pass control to the next component.\n- Middleware can short-circuit the pipeline by not calling `_next(context)`.\n\n#### References\n\n- [ASP.NET Core Middleware Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/)\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ### How .NET Core Handles Memory Management Differently from .NET Framework\n\nBoth .NET Framework and .NET Core use a managed memory model with automatic garbage collection (GC). However, .NET Core introduces several enhancements and differences in memory management compared to the .NET Framework:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Garbage Collector Improvements**\n\n- **Server GC Enhancements:**  \n  .NET Core provides a more efficient and scalable Server GC, optimized for high-throughput and multi-core environments. It offers better performance for cloud and containerized workloads.\n\n- **Low-Latency Modes:**  \n  .NET Core introduces new GC modes, such as **sustained low latency**, which are not available in .NET Framework. These modes help reduce pause times for latency-sensitive applications.\n\n- **Background GC:**  \n  .NET Core's background GC is more efficient and is enabled by default, improving application responsiveness.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Span<T> and Memory<T>**\n\n- .NET Core introduces `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>`, which allow for memory-safe, high-performance manipulation of contiguous memory regions (stack or heap) without allocations. This reduces heap allocations and GC pressure, a feature not present in .NET Framework.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Resource-Constrained Environments**\n\n- .NET Core is designed to run in containers and microservices, where memory is limited. It provides better control over memory usage, such as limiting GC heap size via environment variables (e.g., `COMPlus_GCHeapHardLimit`).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Cross-Platform and Modular GC**\n\n- The GC in .NET Core is cross-platform and decoupled from Windows-specific APIs, allowing for optimizations on Linux and macOS.\n- The modular design enables faster updates and improvements independent of the OS.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Configuration and Diagnostics**\n\n- .NET Core offers more granular GC configuration options via runtimeconfig.json and environment variables.\n- Enhanced diagnostics tools (e.g., `dotnet-gcdump`, `dotnet-trace`) provide deeper insights into memory usage and GC behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Performance Optimizations**\n\n- .NET Core includes optimizations such as tiered compilation and ReadyToRun images, which can reduce memory footprint and improve startup performance.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Feature/Aspect                  | .NET Framework               | .NET Core                      |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| GC Modes                        | Workstation/Server           | Workstation/Server + Low Latency Modes |\n| Span<T>/Memory<T>               | Not available                | Available                      |\n| Container/Cloud Optimization    | Limited                      | Extensive                      |\n| Cross-Platform GC               | Windows-only                 | Cross-platform                 |\n| GC Configuration                | Registry/App.config          | Environment variables/JSON     |\n| Diagnostics                     | Limited                      | Advanced tools                 |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile both platforms use managed memory and garbage collection, .NET Core introduces significant improvements in efficiency, configurability, and support for modern workloads, making its memory management more flexible and performant than that of the .NET Framework.",

        "question": "How do you create and use custom attributes in .NET?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Creating and Using Custom Attributes in .NET\n\nCustom attributes in .NET allow you to add declarative information to your code elements (classes, methods, properties, etc.) that can be retrieved at runtime using reflection. This is supported in both .NET Framework and .NET Core.\n\n#### 1. **Creating a Custom Attribute**\n\nTo create a custom attribute:\n\n- Inherit from `System.Attribute`.\n- Optionally, define constructors and properties/fields for additional data.\n\n```csharp\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method, Inherited = false)]\npublic class AuthorAttribute : Attribute\n{\n    public string Name { get; }\n    public double Version { get; set; }\n\n    public AuthorAttribute(string name)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `AttributeUsage` specifies where the attribute can be applied and its behavior.\n\n#### 2. **Applying the Custom Attribute**\n\nYou can apply your custom attribute to code elements:\n\n```csharp\n[Author(\"Jane Doe\", Version = 1.1)]\npublic class SampleClass\n{\n    [Author(\"John Smith\", Version = 1.0)]\n    public void SampleMethod() { }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Retrieving Attribute Data via Reflection**\n\nYou can use reflection to read attribute data at runtime:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Reflection;\n\nType type = typeof(SampleClass);\n\n// Get custom attributes applied to the class\nobject[] attrs = type.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AuthorAttribute), false);\n\nforeach (AuthorAttribute attr in attrs)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Class Author: {attr.Name}, Version: {attr.Version}\");\n}\n\n// Get custom attributes applied to a method\nMethodInfo method = type.GetMethod(\"SampleMethod\");\nattrs = method.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AuthorAttribute), false);\n\nforeach (AuthorAttribute attr in attrs)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Method Author: {attr.Name}, Version: {attr.Version}\");\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Key Points**\n\n- Custom attributes can be used for metadata, validation, serialization, etc.\n- You can restrict attribute usage with `[AttributeUsage]`.\n- Attributes are accessed at runtime using reflection.\n- Works identically in both .NET Framework and .NET Core.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/)\n```\n",

        "question": "How do you implement cross-cutting concerns in .NET Core applications?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing Cross-Cutting Concerns in .NET Core Applications\n\nCross-cutting concerns—such as logging, caching, validation, exception handling, and security—are aspects of a program that affect multiple layers or components. In .NET Core, these are typically implemented using the following techniques:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Middleware**\n\n- **What:** Middleware are components in the HTTP request pipeline that can inspect, modify, or short-circuit requests and responses.\n- **Use Cases:** Logging, exception handling, authentication, request/response modification.\n- **Example:**\n    ```csharp\n    public class LoggingMiddleware\n    {\n        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;\n        public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;\n\n        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)\n        {\n            // Pre-processing logic (e.g., logging)\n            await _next(context);\n            // Post-processing logic\n        }\n    }\n    // Register in Startup.cs\n    app.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>();\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Dependency Injection (DI) and Decorators**\n\n- **What:** Register services with DI and use decorators to wrap services with additional behavior.\n- **Use Cases:** Caching, validation, logging, authorization at the service level.\n- **Example:**\n    ```csharp\n    public class LoggingServiceDecorator : IMyService\n    {\n        private readonly IMyService _inner;\n        public LoggingServiceDecorator(IMyService inner) => _inner = inner;\n\n        public void DoWork()\n        {\n            // Pre-logic\n            _inner.DoWork();\n            // Post-logic\n        }\n    }\n    // Register decorator in DI container\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Filters (for ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API)**\n\n- **What:** Filters allow code to run before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline.\n- **Types:** Action, Authorization, Exception, Resource, and Result filters.\n- **Use Cases:** Validation, logging, exception handling, authorization.\n- **Example:**\n    ```csharp\n    public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter\n    {\n        public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context) { /* ... */ }\n        public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context) { /* ... */ }\n    }\n    // Register globally or per-controller/action\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Libraries**\n\n- **What:** Use third-party libraries (e.g., [AspectInjector](https://github.com/pamidur/aspect-injector), [Castle DynamicProxy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Castle.Core/)) to inject cross-cutting logic at runtime or compile time.\n- **Use Cases:** Advanced scenarios where built-in mechanisms are insufficient.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Custom Attributes**\n\n- **What:** Define custom attributes and use reflection to apply cross-cutting logic.\n- **Use Cases:** Simple validation, metadata-driven behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach         | Scope                | Typical Use Cases           |\n|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Middleware       | HTTP Pipeline        | Logging, error handling     |\n| DI/Decorators    | Service/Business     | Caching, logging            |\n| Filters          | MVC/Web API Layer    | Auth, validation, logging   |\n| AOP Libraries    | Any                  | Profiling, auditing         |\n| Custom Attributes| Any                  | Validation, metadata        |\n\n---\n\n**Best Practice:**  \nChoose the mechanism that best matches the scope of your cross-cutting concern. For HTTP-level concerns, use middleware. For controller/action-level, use filters. For service-level, use decorators or AOP.\n\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Differences in Threading Models between .NET Framework and .NET Core\n\n#### 1. **Thread Pool Implementation**\n- **.NET Framework:**  \n  Uses a legacy thread pool implementation that is tightly coupled with the Windows operating system. The thread pool is managed by the `ThreadPool` class, and its behavior is influenced by the underlying Windows thread scheduler.\n- **.NET Core:**  \n  Introduces a new, portable thread pool implementation written in managed code. This thread pool is optimized for cross-platform scenarios and offers improved scalability and performance, especially on non-Windows platforms.\n\n#### 2. **Platform Dependency**\n- **.NET Framework:**  \n  Threading is heavily dependent on Windows APIs (e.g., Win32 threads), making it less portable and optimized for Windows environments.\n- **.NET Core:**  \n  Designed to be cross-platform, using platform-agnostic abstractions. On Linux and macOS, it leverages native threading primitives (like pthreads) but manages them through its own runtime abstractions.\n\n#### 3. **Synchronization Primitives**\n- **.NET Framework:**  \n  Synchronization primitives (like `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `EventWaitHandle`) are wrappers around Windows kernel objects.\n- **.NET Core:**  \n  Provides lightweight, managed implementations for many synchronization primitives, reducing reliance on OS-specific kernel objects and improving performance, especially on non-Windows systems.\n\n#### 4. **Async/Await and Task Parallel Library (TPL)**\n- **.NET Framework:**  \n  Supports `async`/`await` and TPL, but some features and optimizations (like `ValueTask`, improved scheduling) are limited or unavailable.\n- **.NET Core:**  \n  Enhanced support for asynchronous programming and TPL, including new APIs, better scheduling, and improved performance for async workloads.\n\n#### 5. **Thread Affinity and UI Threading**\n- **.NET Framework:**  \n  UI frameworks (WinForms, WPF) are tightly coupled with the Windows message loop and require thread affinity (UI components must be accessed from the main thread).\n- **.NET Core:**  \n  While .NET Core 3+ supports WinForms and WPF on Windows, it also enables cross-platform UI frameworks (like MAUI) that abstract thread affinity, making it easier to write cross-platform UI code.\n\n#### 6. **Garbage Collection and Threading**\n- **.NET Framework:**  \n  Garbage Collector (GC) is optimized for server and workstation modes but is less efficient in multi-core, high-concurrency scenarios.\n- **.NET Core:**  \n  GC is redesigned for better scalability and performance in multi-core environments, with features like low-latency GC and improved thread management.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Feature                        | .NET Framework                      | .NET Core                                 |\n|------------------------------- |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Thread Pool                    | Windows-specific, legacy            | Portable, managed, cross-platform         |\n| Platform Dependency            | Windows-only                        | Cross-platform                            |\n| Synchronization Primitives     | Windows kernel objects              | Managed, lightweight implementations      |\n| Async/TPL Enhancements         | Limited                             | Improved, new APIs                        |\n| UI Threading                   | Windows message loop, thread affinity| Cross-platform abstractions               |\n| GC and Threading               | Less optimized for concurrency      | Enhanced for scalability and performance  |\n\n**In summary:**  \n.NET Core introduces a modern, cross-platform threading model with improved performance, scalability, and portability, while .NET Framework remains tightly coupled to Windows threading and synchronization mechanisms.\n```\n",

        "question": "How do you secure sensitive data in .NET Core applications?",
        "answer": "```markdown ### Securing Sensitive Data in .NET Core Applications\n\nSecuring sensitive data is crucial for protecting user information and maintaining application integrity. In .NET Core applications, you can use several strategies and built-in features to safeguard sensitive data:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Configuration Secrets Management**\n\n- **User Secrets (Development):**\n  - Use the [Secret Manager tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) for storing sensitive data (like API keys, connection strings) during development.\n  - Example:\n    ```bash\n    dotnet user-secrets set \"ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection\" \"YourConnectionString\"\n    ```\n\n- **Environment Variables (Production):**\n  - Store secrets in environment variables, which are read at runtime.\n  - Example:\n    ```csharp\n    var secret = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MySecret\");\n    ```\n\n- **Azure Key Vault / AWS Secrets Manager:**\n  - Integrate with cloud-based secret stores for production environments.\n  - Example (Azure Key Vault):\n    ```csharp\n    builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(\n        new Uri(keyVaultEndpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential());\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection API**\n\n- Use the [Data Protection API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/introduction) for encrypting data at rest (e.g., cookies, tokens).\n- Example:\n    ```csharp\n    var protector = _provider.CreateProtector(\"MyPurpose\");\n    var protectedData = protector.Protect(\"SensitiveData\");\n    var unprotectedData = protector.Unprotect(protectedData);\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Encryption and Hashing**\n\n- **Encryption:** Use libraries like `System.Security.Cryptography` for encrypting sensitive data before storing it.\n- **Hashing:** Store only hashed values for passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2).\n    ```csharp\n    var hashed = BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword(password);\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Secure Transmission**\n\n- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n- Enforce HTTPS redirection in `Startup.cs`:\n    ```csharp\n    app.UseHttpsRedirection();\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Input Validation and Output Encoding**\n\n- Prevent injection attacks by validating and encoding user input.\n- Use built-in model validation and libraries like `System.Text.Encodings.Web`.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Access Control**\n\n- Use ASP.NET Core Identity or custom authentication/authorization to restrict access to sensitive data.\n- Example:\n    ```csharp\n    [Authorize(Roles = \"Admin\")]\n    public IActionResult SecureAction() { ... }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Logging Best Practices**\n\n- Never log sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).\n- Use structured logging and configure log levels appropriately.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Regular Security Updates**\n\n- Keep .NET Core and all dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Method                        | Use Case                          | Example/Tool                |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| User Secrets                  | Dev secret storage                | `dotnet user-secrets`       |\n| Environment Variables         | Prod secret storage               | `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` |\n| Key Vault/Secrets Manager     | Centralized secret management     | Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager |\n| Data Protection API           | Encrypting data at rest           | `IDataProtector`            |\n| Encryption/Hashing            | Protecting stored data            | `System.Security.Cryptography` |\n| HTTPS                         | Secure data in transit            | `app.UseHttpsRedirection()` |\n| Access Control                | Restricting data access           | `[Authorize]` attribute     |\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Secure ASP.NET Core apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/)\n- [OWASP .NET Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DotNet_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\nBy following these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of sensitive data in your .NET Core applications.",
