    "question": "How does the catch block work in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, the `catch` block is used to handle exceptions that occur in the associated `try` block. When an exception is thrown inside the `try` block, the runtime looks for a matching `catch` block to handle the error. The code inside the `catch` block is executed, allowing you to respond to the error, log it, or take corrective action.\n\n**Basic Syntax:**\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Code that might throw an exception\n}\ncatch (ExceptionType ex)\n{\n    // Code to handle the exception\n}\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    int number = int.Parse(\"abc\"); // This will throw a FormatException\n}\ncatch (FormatException ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Input string is not a valid number.\");\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- You can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different exception types.\n- If no exception occurs, the `catch` block is skipped.\n- The `catch` block can access the exception object (e.g., `ex`) for more details about the error.\n```\n",

    "question": "How does exception propagation work in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown ### How Exception Propagation Works in C#\n\nIn C#, **exception propagation** refers to the process by which an exception moves up the call stack until it is caught by a matching `catch` block or causes the program to terminate if unhandled.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n1. **Exception Thrown:** When an error occurs, an exception is thrown using the `throw` statement.\n2. **Searching for a Handler:** The runtime looks for a `catch` block that can handle the exception, starting in the current method.\n3. **Moving Up the Call Stack:** \n    - If no suitable `catch` block is found in the current method, the exception propagates to the calling method.\n    - This process repeats up the call stack until a matching `catch` block is found.\n4. **Unhandled Exception:** \n    - If the exception reaches the top of the call stack without being caught, the program terminates and displays an error message.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\nvoid MethodA()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        MethodB();\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Caught in MethodA: \" + ex.Message);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid MethodB()\n{\n    MethodC();\n}\n\nvoid MethodC()\n{\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Something went wrong!\");\n}\n```\n\n- `MethodC` throws an exception.\n- `MethodB` does not handle it, so the exception propagates to `MethodA`.\n- `MethodA` has a `try-catch` block, so the exception is caught there.\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- Exception propagation allows centralized error handling.\n- Only the first matching `catch` block handles the exception.\n- If no handler is found, the application will terminate.\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n- Catch exceptions at the appropriate level where you can handle them meaningfully.\n- Avoid catching exceptions too early unless you can resolve or log them properly.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** Exception propagation in C# moves exceptions up the call stack until a suitable handler is found, enabling structured and centralized error handling.",

When you await the Task, any exceptions are re-thrown at the await point, allowing you to catch them with try-catch.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task MyAsyncMethod()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // Await an asynchronous operation that may throw\n        await SomeOtherAsyncMethod();\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        // Handle the exception\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Exception caught: {ex.Message}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Place the try-catch block inside the async method, wrapping the await statement.\n- If you do not await the Task (e.g., fire-and-forget), exceptions may go unobserved unless you attach a continuation or handle the Task's Exception property.\n- For methods returning Task, exceptions are propagated to the caller and can be caught when the Task is awaited.\n\n**Catching exceptions from awaited tasks:**\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    await MyAsyncMethod();\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    // Handle exceptions thrown from MyAsyncMethod\n}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nAlways use try-catch around await statements to handle exceptions in asynchronous methods. If you do not await the Task, check the Task.Exception property or use continuations to observe exceptions.\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown\n### Handling Exceptions in Parallel Programming in C#\n\nIn parallel programming with C# (using `Parallel.For`, `Parallel.ForEach`, or `Task`), exceptions are handled differently than in sequential code. When multiple tasks or iterations throw exceptions, these are aggregated and thrown as an `AggregateException`.\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Exceptions are not thrown immediately:** In parallel loops or tasks, exceptions are captured and wrapped in an `AggregateException`.\n- **AggregateException:** This exception contains all the exceptions thrown by individual tasks or iterations.\n\n#### Example: Handling Exceptions in `Parallel.For`\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>\n    {\n        if (i == 5)\n            throw new InvalidOperationException($\"Error at iteration {i}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(i);\n    });\n}\ncatch (AggregateException ex)\n{\n    foreach (var inner in ex.InnerExceptions)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Caught exception: {inner.Message}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Handling Exceptions in Tasks\n\n```csharp\nvar tasks = new List<Task>();\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n{\n    int local = i;\n    tasks.Add(Task.Run(() =>\n    {\n        if (local == 2)\n            throw new Exception(\"Task failed\");\n    }));\n}\n\ntry\n{\n    Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());\n}\ncatch (AggregateException ex)\n{\n    ex.Handle(e =>\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Handled exception: {e.Message}\");\n        return true; // Mark as handled\n    });\n}\n```\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n- Always catch `AggregateException` when using parallel constructs.\n- Use the `Handle` method of `AggregateException` to process or filter exceptions.\n- Be aware that if an exception is unhandled, it will propagate and may terminate your application.\n\n#### References\n\n- [Microsoft Docs: Exception Handling in Task Parallel Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/exception-handling-task-parallel-library)\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown Exception filters in C# are a feature that allows you to specify a condition for a catch block to handle an exception. They enable more granular and expressive error handling by letting you catch exceptions only when certain criteria are met, without resorting to rethrowing or nesting catch blocks.\n\n## Syntax\n\nException filters use the `when` keyword in a catch clause:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Code that may throw an exception\n}\ncatch (Exception ex) when (/* condition */)\n{\n    // Handle exception if condition is true\n}\n```\n\n## How They Work\n\n- The condition after `when` is a boolean expression.\n- If the exception is thrown, the runtime evaluates the filter.\n- If the filter returns `true`, the catch block executes.\n- If it returns `false`, the exception continues to propagate and may be caught by another catch block or higher up the call stack.\n\n## Example\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Some code that may throw\n}\ncatch (IOException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains(\"disk full\"))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Handle disk full error specifically.\");\n}\ncatch (IOException ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Handle other IO exceptions.\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The first catch block only handles `IOException` if the message contains \"disk full\".\n- Other IO exceptions are handled by the second catch block.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Improved Readability:** Keeps catch blocks focused and avoids deeply nested try-catch structures.\n- **No Side Effects:** The filter expression should be free of side effects, as it may be evaluated multiple times.\n- **Selective Handling:** Enables handling exceptions based on runtime state or exception data.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Logging only certain exceptions.\n- Handling exceptions differently based on environment or user context.\n- Filtering exceptions based on properties (e.g., error codes, messages).\n\n## Notes\n\n- Exception filters are available in C# 6.0 and later.\n- They are especially useful in asynchronous programming and when working with complex exception hierarchies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nException filters in C# use the `when` keyword to conditionally handle exceptions in catch blocks, making error handling more precise and expressive.",

If it remains unhandled, the .NET runtime terminates the application and may display an error message.\n- **Example:**\n  ```csharp\n  int x = int.Parse(\"not a number\"); // No try-catch block\n  ```\n- **Outcome:** The application crashes, and the runtime may display a stack trace or error dialog.\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                | Handled Exception                | Unhandled Exception             |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Caught by code?       | Yes (`try-catch`)                | No                              |\n| Application continues?| Usually                          | No (application terminates)     |\n| Error reporting       | Controlled (custom messages/log) | Default runtime error message   |\n| Recovery possible?    | Yes                              | No (unless handled globally)    |\n\n#### Best Practice\n\nAlways handle exceptions where recovery or meaningful error reporting is possible.

    "answer": "```markdown\nTo globally handle unhandled exceptions in a C# application, you can subscribe to special events provided by the .NET runtime. This allows you to log, display, or otherwise process exceptions that are not caught elsewhere in your code.\n\n### For Console Applications\n\nSubscribe to the following events at the start of your application (e.g., in `Main`):\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) =>\n        {\n            Exception ex = (Exception)e.ExceptionObject;\n            // Log or handle the exception\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Unhandled exception: {ex.Message}\");\n        };\n\n        // Your application code here\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### For Windows Forms Applications\n\nHandle both `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` and `Application.ThreadException`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nstatic class Program\n{\n    [STAThread]\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Application.ThreadException += (sender, e) =>\n        {\n            // Handle UI thread exceptions\n            MessageBox.Show($\"UI Thread exception: {e.Exception.Message}\");\n        };\n\n        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) =>\n        {\n            Exception ex = (Exception)e.ExceptionObject;\n            // Handle non-UI thread exceptions\n            MessageBox.Show($\"Non-UI Thread exception: {ex.Message}\");\n        };\n\n        Application.EnableVisualStyles();\n        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\n        Application.Run(new MainForm());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### For WPF Applications\n\nHandle `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` and `Application.DispatcherUnhandledException`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows;\n\npublic partial class App : Application\n{\n    public App()\n    {\n        this.DispatcherUnhandledException += (sender, e) =>\n        {\n            // Handle UI thread exceptions\n            MessageBox.Show($\"UI Thread exception: {e.Exception.Message}\");\n            e.Handled = true;\n        };\n\n        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) =>\n        {\n            Exception ex = (Exception)e.ExceptionObject;\n            // Handle non-UI thread exceptions\n            MessageBox.Show($\"Non-UI Thread exception: {ex.Message}\");\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- These handlers should be set as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.\n- Global exception handlers are a last resort; always use local try-catch blocks where possible.\n- Unhandled exceptions may terminate the application, especially in .NET Core and later.\n- For ASP.NET applications, use `Application_Error` in `Global.asax` or middleware for global exception handling.\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Handling and Throwing Exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/)\n- [AppDomain.UnhandledException Event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.appdomain.unhandledexception)\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown ### Fatal Exceptions in C# and Their Handling\n\n**Fatal exceptions** are errors that occur during the execution of a program and indicate conditions from which the application cannot reasonably recover. These exceptions typically represent serious problems such as:\n\n- Out of memory (`OutOfMemoryException`)\n- Stack overflow (`StackOverflowException`)\n- Access violations (`AccessViolationException`)\n- Execution engine failures (`ExecutionEngineException`)\n\n#### Characteristics of Fatal Exceptions\n\n- **Unrecoverable:** The application state is likely corrupted, making it unsafe or impossible to continue execution.\n- **Not Meant to be Caught:** Many fatal exceptions are not meant to be caught or handled in user code. For example, catching `StackOverflowException` or `ExecutionEngineException` is not possible in .NET Core and later versions.\n- **Process Termination:** The .NET runtime will often terminate the process when a fatal exception occurs to prevent further damage or data corruption.\n\n#### Handling Fatal Exceptions\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Do Not Catch Fatal Exceptions:**  \n   Avoid catching fatal exceptions in general `catch` blocks. Use specific exception types in your catch statements to prevent accidentally catching fatal exceptions.\n   ```csharp\n   try\n   {\n       // Code that may throw exceptions\n   }\n   catch (IOException ex)\n   {\n       // Handle IO exceptions\n   }\n   // Avoid: catch (Exception ex) { ... }\n   ```\n\n2. **Fail Fast:**  \n   If a fatal exception is detected, allow the application to terminate. This prevents running in an unpredictable or corrupted state.\n\n3. **Use AppDomain.UnhandledException:**  \n   For logging or cleanup purposes, you can subscribe to the `AppDomain.UnhandledException` event. However, do not attempt to recover or continue execution from this event.\n   ```csharp\n   AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) =>\n   {\n       // Log the exception\n       var ex = e.ExceptionObject as Exception;\n       LogException(ex);\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Design for Robustness:**  \n   Write code defensively to minimize the chance of fatal exceptions (e.g., avoid unbounded recursion, manage memory usage carefully).\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Exception Type             | Can Be Caught? | Should Be Handled? | Typical Action         |\n|---------------------------|:--------------:|:------------------:|-----------------------|\n| `OutOfMemoryException`    | Yes*           | No                 | Log and terminate     |\n| `StackOverflowException`  | No             | No                 | Process terminates    |\n| `AccessViolationException`| Yes*           | No                 | Log and terminate     |\n| `ExecutionEngineException`| No             | No                 | Process terminates    |\n\n\\* In .NET Core and later, some exceptions cannot be caught even with try/catch.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nFatal exceptions indicate irrecoverable errors. The recommended approach is to let the application terminate, possibly logging the error for diagnostics, but never attempting to continue execution. Always write code to avoid these exceptions rather than trying to handle them.",

Exception swallowing occurs when an exception is caught but not acted upon, which can obscure bugs and make debugging difficult.\n\n**Best Practices to Prevent Exception Swallowing:**\n\n1. **Avoid Empty Catch Blocks**\n   ```csharp\n   try\n   {\n       // Some code that may throw\n   }\n   catch (Exception)\n   {\n       // BAD: Swallows the exception\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Log Exceptions**\n   Always log exceptions if you catch them, so you have a record of what went wrong.\n   ```csharp\n   try\n   {\n       // Some code\n   }\n   catch (Exception ex)\n   {\n       // Log the exception\n       logger.LogError(ex, \"An error occurred\");\n       throw; // Rethrow to preserve stack trace\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Rethrow Exceptions Properly**\n   Use `throw;` (not `throw ex;`) to preserve the original stack trace.\n   ```csharp\n   catch (Exception ex)\n   {\n       // Optionally log\n       throw; // Preserves stack trace\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Catch Specific Exceptions**\n   Only catch exceptions you can handle meaningfully.\n   ```csharp\n   try\n   {\n       // Some code\n   }\n   catch (FileNotFoundException ex)\n   {\n       // Handle file not found\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Avoid Catching System.Exception Unnecessarily**\n   Catching all exceptions can hide critical errors (like `OutOfMemoryException`).\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Practice                       | Prevents Swallowing? | Preserves Info? |\n|------------------------------- |:-------------------:|:---------------:|\n| Empty catch block              | ❌                  | ❌              |\n| Logging and rethrowing         | ✅                  | ✅              |\n| Catching specific exceptions   | ✅                  | ✅              |\n| Using `throw;` (not `throw ex;`)| ✅                  | ✅              |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPrevent exception swallowing by handling exceptions appropriately: log them, rethrow if you can't handle, and always catch the most specific exception types possible. This ensures errors are visible and debuggable.",

    "question": "What are best practices for designing custom exceptions in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### Best Practices for Designing Custom Exceptions in C#\n\nWhen designing custom exceptions in C#, follow these best practices to ensure clarity, maintainability, and consistency:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Appropriate Base Class**\n   - Derive custom exceptions from `System.Exception` or a more specific subclass like `ApplicationException` (rarely used) or `ArgumentException` if applicable.\n   - Avoid inheriting from `System.SystemException` or `System.Exception` directly unless necessary.\n\n2. **Use the \"Exception\" Suffix**\n   - Name your custom exception classes with the \"Exception\" suffix for clarity (e.g., `InvalidOrderException`).\n\n3. **Implement Standard Constructors**\n   - Provide the following constructors:\n     - Parameterless constructor\n     - Constructor with a `string` message\n     - Constructor with a `string` message and an `Exception` inner exception\n     - Protected constructor for serialization\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class InvalidOrderException : Exception\n   {\n       public InvalidOrderException() { }\n       public InvalidOrderException(string message) : base(message) { }\n       public InvalidOrderException(string message, Exception inner) : base(message, inner) { }\n       protected InvalidOrderException(\n         System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info,\n         System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext context) : base(info, context) { }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Be Specific and Document Usage**\n   - Create custom exceptions only for exceptional conditions specific to your domain or application logic.\n   - Document when and why the exception should be thrown.\n\n5. **Support Serialization**\n   - Mark the class with `[Serializable]` and implement the protected serialization constructor if your exception may be serialized (e.g., in distributed applications).\n\n   ```csharp\n   [Serializable]\n   public class InvalidOrderException : Exception\n   {\n       // Constructors as above\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Avoid Overusing Custom Exceptions**\n   - Prefer using built-in exceptions (e.g., `ArgumentNullException`, `InvalidOperationException`) when they accurately describe the error condition.\n\n7. **Do Not Catch General Exceptions**\n   - Avoid catching `Exception` unless you have a compelling reason; catch specific exceptions instead.\n\n8. **Include Relevant Data**\n   - If needed, add properties to provide additional context (e.g., an order ID in `InvalidOrderException`).\n\n   ```csharp\n   public int OrderId { get; }\n   public InvalidOrderException(string message, int orderId) : base(message)\n   {\n       OrderId = orderId;\n   }\n   ```\n\n9. **Keep Exceptions Lightweight**\n   - Avoid heavy logic or resource allocation in exception constructors.\n\n10. **Document Exception Throwing**\n    - Clearly document which methods may throw your custom exception and under what circumstances.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Best Practices for Exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/best-practices-for-exceptions)\n- [Microsoft Docs: Creating and Throwing Exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/how-to-create-user-defined-exceptions)\n```\n",

    "question": "How does exception handling impact performance in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown Exception handling in C#—using try, catch, and finally blocks—has a measurable impact on performance, but the effect depends on how exceptions are used:\n\n- **Normal Execution (No Exception Thrown):**\n  - The presence of try/catch blocks incurs minimal overhead. The JIT compiler optimizes for the common case where no exception is thrown, so wrapping code in try blocks is generally inexpensive.\n  - However, excessive or deeply nested try/catch blocks can slightly increase code size and affect inlining, which may have a minor impact on performance.\n\n- **When an Exception is Thrown:**\n  - Throwing and catching exceptions is **expensive**. The runtime must:\n    - Capture the current stack trace.\n    - Unwind the call stack to find a matching catch block.\n    - Allocate and initialize the exception object.\n  - This process is significantly slower than regular control flow—often by orders of magnitude.\n\n- **Best Practices:**\n  - **Do not use exceptions for normal control flow.** Exceptions should signal truly exceptional or error conditions.\n  - Use return codes or other mechanisms for expected conditions (e.g., parsing failures).\n  - Minimize the scope of try blocks to only the code that may throw.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Scenario                        | Performance Impact      |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| try/catch, no exception thrown   | Minimal                |\n| Exception thrown and caught      | Significant overhead   |\n| Frequent exception usage         | Severe performance hit |\n\n**References:**\n- [Microsoft Docs: Best Practices for Exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/best-practices-for-exceptions)\n- [Eric Lippert: Vexing Exceptions](https://ericlippert.com/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions/)\n\n**In short:**  \nException handling is efficient when exceptions are rare, but throwing and catching exceptions is slow.

    "answer": "```markdown\nIn C#, exceptions in LINQ queries can occur during query execution, especially with deferred execution (e.g., when using `IEnumerable<T>`). To handle exceptions in LINQ queries:\n\n1. **Wrap the query execution in a try-catch block:**  \n   Since LINQ queries are often lazily evaluated, exceptions are thrown when you enumerate the results (e.g., with `foreach`, `ToList()`, etc.), not when you define the query.\n\n   ```csharp\n   try\n   {\n       var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 0, 4 };\n       var results = numbers.Select(n => 10 / n);\n\n       foreach (var result in results)\n       {\n           Console.WriteLine(result);\n       }\n   }\n   catch (DivideByZeroException ex)\n   {\n       Console.WriteLine($\"Exception caught: {ex.Message}\");\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Handle exceptions within the query using helper methods:**  \n   You can use a helper method inside your query to catch and handle exceptions for each element.\n\n   ```csharp\n   var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 0, 4 };\n   var results = numbers.Select(n => SafeDivide(10, n));\n\n   foreach (var result in results)\n   {\n       Console.WriteLine(result);\n   }\n\n   int SafeDivide(int numerator, int denominator)\n   {\n       try\n       {\n           return numerator / denominator;\n       }\n       catch (DivideByZeroException)\n       {\n           return 0; // or any default/error value\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use a try-catch block around the enumeration of the LINQ query.\n- Alternatively, handle exceptions for each element within the query using helper methods.\n```\n",

For more robust solutions, you might use libraries like [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly).\n\n### Example: Manual Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff\n\n```csharp\nint maxRetries = 5;\nint delay = 1000; // Initial delay in milliseconds\n\nfor (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // Attempt the operation\n        PerformOperation();\n        break; // Success, exit the loop\n    }\n    catch (TransientException ex) // Replace with your specific transient exception\n    {\n        if (attempt == maxRetries)\n        {\n            // Rethrow if max retries reached\n            throw;\n        }\n        // Wait before retrying (exponential backoff)\n        Thread.Sleep(delay);\n        delay *= 2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Example: Using Polly Library\n\nPolly is a popular .NET library for resilience and transient-fault handling.\n\n```csharp\nusing Polly;\nusing Polly.Retry;\n\nvar retryPolicy = Policy\n    .Handle<TransientException>() // Replace with your transient exception\n    .WaitAndRetry(\n        retryCount: 5,\n        sleepDurationProvider: attempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, attempt))\n    );\n\nretryPolicy.Execute(() =>\n{\n    PerformOperation();\n});\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Identify transient errors:** Only retry on exceptions that are likely to be resolved by retrying.\n- **Limit retries:** Set a maximum number of attempts to avoid infinite loops.\n- **Backoff strategy:** Use delays between retries, preferably with exponential backoff.\n- **Use libraries:** Consider Polly for more advanced scenarios (circuit breakers, fallback, etc.).\n\n**References:**\n- [Polly Documentation](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)\n- [Microsoft Docs: Transient Fault Handling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults)\n```\n",

    "question": "What is the difference between catching Exception and catching specific exception types?",
    "answer": "```markdown When handling errors in C#, you can catch exceptions in two main ways: by catching the base Exception type or by catching specific exception types. Here’s the difference:\n\n## Catching `Exception`\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Code that may throw an exception\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    // Handles any exception derived from System.Exception\n}\n```\n\n- **Catches all exceptions**: This block will catch any exception that inherits from `System.Exception`, including both expected and unexpected errors.\n- **Less precise**: It can make debugging harder because you might inadvertently catch exceptions you didn’t anticipate, potentially hiding bugs.\n- **Not recommended for most cases**: Catching all exceptions can mask programming errors (like `NullReferenceException` or `OutOfMemoryException`) that should usually be allowed to crash the program or be handled differently.\n\n## Catching Specific Exception Types\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Code that may throw an exception\n}\ncatch (FileNotFoundException ex)\n{\n    // Handles only FileNotFoundException\n}\ncatch (IOException ex)\n{\n    // Handles other IO exceptions\n}\n```\n\n- **Catches only specified exceptions**: Each catch block handles a particular exception type, allowing for tailored error handling.\n- **More precise and safer**: You can provide appropriate responses for different error conditions and avoid swallowing unexpected exceptions.\n- **Best practice**: It’s generally better to catch only the exceptions you expect and know how to handle.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Approach                | Scope                     | Use Case                        | Risk                        |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| `catch (Exception ex)`  | All exceptions            | Last-resort, logging, fallback   | May hide bugs, less control |\n| `catch (SpecificType)`  | Specific exception types  | Expected/known error conditions  | More robust, safer          |\n\n**In summary:**  \nCatching specific exception types is preferred because it allows for more controlled and meaningful error handling, while catching `Exception` is broader and riskier, and should be reserved for scenarios where you need to handle any error in a generic way (such as logging unhandled exceptions).",

    "answer": "```markdown To test exception handling in C# unit tests, you typically use the testing framework’s features to assert that a specific exception is thrown under certain conditions.

    "question": "What is the purpose of the FaultException class in WCF?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nThe `FaultException` class in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is used to handle and communicate errors between a WCF service and its clients in a controlled and interoperable manner. Unlike standard .NET exceptions, which may not serialize well across service boundaries, `FaultException` allows services to send SOAP faults that can be understood by clients regardless of their platform.\n\n**Purpose of FaultException in WCF:**\n\n- **Standardized Error Communication:** It enables WCF services to return detailed error information to clients using SOAP fault messages, rather than unhandled exceptions that could reveal sensitive information or cause interoperability issues.\n- **Custom Faults:** By using the generic `FaultException<TDetail>`, developers can define and send custom error details (data contracts) to clients, allowing for rich error information while maintaining strong typing.\n- **Graceful Error Handling:** Clients can catch `FaultException` and handle specific service errors gracefully, improving robustness and user experience.\n- **Security:** It helps prevent leaking internal exception details to clients, as only the information included in the fault contract is sent.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n// Define a fault contract\n[DataContract]\npublic class MyCustomFault\n{\n    [DataMember]\n    public string ErrorMessage { get; set; }\n}\n\n// Service operation with FaultContract\n[OperationContract]\n[FaultContract(typeof(MyCustomFault))]\nvoid MyServiceOperation();\n\n// Throwing a FaultException in the service\nthrow new FaultException<MyCustomFault>(\n    new MyCustomFault { ErrorMessage = \"A specific error occurred.\" },\n    new FaultReason(\"Custom error\")\n);\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \n`FaultException` is essential in WCF for robust, interoperable, and secure error handling, allowing services to communicate faults to clients in a standardized way.\n```",

    "question": "How can you handle exceptions in ASP.NET Core applications?",
    "answer": "```markdown\nIn ASP.NET Core applications, exception handling is crucial for building robust and user-friendly web applications. Here are advanced techniques for handling exceptions:\n\n### 1. **Middleware for Global Exception Handling**\n\nASP.NET Core provides middleware to catch unhandled exceptions globally. The most common approach is to use the built-in `UseExceptionHandler` middleware in `Startup.cs`:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)\n{\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\n    {\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Home/Error\"); // Redirects to Error action\n        app.UseHsts();\n    }\n    // Other middleware...\n}\n```\n\nYou can also configure a custom exception handling lambda:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>\n{\n    errorApp.Run(async context =>\n    {\n        context.Response.StatusCode = 500;\n        context.Response.ContentType = \"application/json\";\n        var errorFeature = context.Features.Get<IExceptionHandlerFeature>();\n        if (errorFeature != null)\n        {\n            var ex = errorFeature.Error;\n            // Log the exception, etc.\n            await context.Response.WriteAsync(new\n            {\n                error = ex.Message\n            }.ToString());\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### 2. **Exception Filters**\n\nFor more granular control, you can use exception filters at the controller or action level:\n\n```csharp\npublic class CustomExceptionFilter : IExceptionFilter\n{\n    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)\n    {\n        // Log exception, set result, etc.\n        context.Result = new ObjectResult(\"An error occurred\")\n        {\n            StatusCode = 500\n        };\n        context.ExceptionHandled = true;\n    }\n}\n\n// Register globally in Startup.cs\nservices.AddControllers(options =>\n{\n    options.Filters.Add<CustomExceptionFilter>();\n});\n```\n\n### 3. **Try-Catch Blocks**\n\nFor specific code sections, use traditional try-catch blocks:\n\n```csharp\npublic IActionResult MyAction()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // Code that may throw\n    }\n    catch (SpecificException ex)\n    {\n        // Handle specific exception\n        return BadRequest(\"Specific error occurred\");\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        // Handle general exceptions\n        return StatusCode(500, \"An error occurred\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Logging Exceptions**\n\nAlways log exceptions for diagnostics. Use built-in logging:\n\n```csharp\nprivate readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;\n\npublic HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)\n{\n    _logger = logger;\n}\n\npublic IActionResult Index()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        _logger.LogError(ex, \"An error occurred in Index\");\n        throw; // Optionally rethrow\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Problem Details for HTTP APIs**\n\nFor APIs, use standardized error responses:\n\n```csharp\napp.UseExceptionHandler(appBuilder =>\n{\n    appBuilder.Run(async context =>\n    {\n        context.Response.StatusCode = 500;\n        context.Response.ContentType = \"application/problem+json\";\n        var error = context.Features.Get<IExceptionHandlerFeature>()?.Error;\n        var problem = new ProblemDetails\n        {\n            Status = 500,\n            Title = \"An error occurred\",\n            Detail = error?.Message\n        };\n        await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync(problem);\n    });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nHandle exceptions in ASP.NET Core using global middleware, exception filters, try-catch blocks, and proper logging. For APIs, return standardized error responses using `ProblemDetails`. This ensures your application is robust, secure, and provides meaningful feedback to users and developers.\n```\n",

    "question": "How do you propagate exceptions across application domains?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### Propagating Exceptions Across Application Domains in C#\n\nIn .NET, **application domains** (AppDomains) provide isolation between executing applications. When you execute code in another AppDomain (for example, using `AppDomain.DoCallBack` or `AppDomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap`), exceptions that occur in the remote domain can be propagated back to the calling domain, but with some important considerations:\n\n#### 1. Exception Serialization\n\n- **Exceptions must be serializable** to cross AppDomain boundaries. Most built-in exceptions in .NET are serializable (they have the `[Serializable]` attribute).\n- If you throw a custom exception, ensure it is marked with `[Serializable]` and implements the serialization constructor.\n\n#### 2. How Exceptions Are Propagated\n\n- When an exception is thrown in a remote AppDomain, the .NET runtime serializes the exception object and sends it to the calling AppDomain.\n- The calling AppDomain receives a deserialized copy of the exception and can catch it as usual.\n\n#### 3. Example\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;\n\n[Serializable]\npublic class MyCustomException : Exception\n{\n    public MyCustomException(string message) : base(message) { }\n    protected MyCustomException(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)\n        : base(info, context) { }\n}\n\npublic class Worker : MarshalByRefObject\n{\n    public void DoWork()\n    {\n        throw new MyCustomException(\"Something went wrong in the other AppDomain!\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        AppDomain domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(\"NewDomain\");\n        try\n        {\n            var worker = (Worker)domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(\n                typeof(Worker).Assembly.FullName,\n                typeof(Worker).FullName);\n            worker.DoWork();\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Caught exception: {ex.GetType().Name} - {ex.Message}\");\n        }\n        finally\n        {\n            AppDomain.Unload(domain);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Important Notes\n\n- **Stack Trace:** The stack trace in the exception will reflect the remote AppDomain, not the calling domain.\n- **Type Fidelity:** If the exception type is not available in the calling AppDomain, a `SerializationException` or a generic `Exception` may be thrown instead.\n- **AppDomain Boundaries:** Exception propagation only works if the exception is serializable and both domains can resolve the exception type.\n\n#### 5. Best Practices\n\n- Always make custom exceptions serializable.\n- Avoid passing non-serializable objects in exception properties.\n- Handle exceptions at the AppDomain boundary to avoid losing information.\n\n**References:**\n- [MSDN: Handling and Propagating Exceptions Across AppDomain Boundaries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/handling-and-propagating-exceptions)\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown\n### Limitations of Exception Handling in C#\n\nException handling in C# is a powerful mechanism, but it has several limitations and caveats that developers should be aware of:\n\n1. **Performance Overhead**  \n   Throwing and catching exceptions is computationally expensive. Overusing exceptions, especially for control flow, can significantly degrade performance.\n\n2. **Not All Errors are Exceptions**  \n   Some errors, such as stack overflows, out-of-memory conditions, or hardware failures, may not be catchable using standard exception handling mechanisms.\n\n3. **Resource Leaks**  \n   If resources (like file handles or database connections) are not properly released (e.g., by forgetting to use `finally` or `using`), exceptions can lead to resource leaks.\n\n4. **Exception Swallowing**  \n   Catch blocks that are too broad (e.g., `catch (Exception)`) can inadvertently hide bugs by swallowing exceptions, making debugging difficult.\n\n5. **Loss of Context**  \n   Rethrowing exceptions incorrectly (e.g., using `throw ex;` instead of `throw;`) can lose the original stack trace, making it harder to diagnose issues.\n\n6. **Unhandled Exceptions**  \n   If exceptions are not properly handled, they can crash the application. In multi-threaded applications, unhandled exceptions in threads can be particularly problematic.\n\n7. **Non-deterministic Behavior**  \n   Exceptions can make program flow harder to reason about, especially in complex systems, leading to unpredictable behavior if not managed carefully.\n\n8. **Limited to Managed Code**  \n   Exception handling in C# works only within managed code. Unmanaged code (e.g., native DLLs) may not propagate exceptions in a way that C# can handle.\n\n9. **Exception Filters are Limited**  \n   While C# supports exception filters (`catch (Exception ex) when (...)`), their use is limited compared to some other languages, and they can't always express complex filtering logic.\n\n10. **No Compile-Time Checking**  \n    Unlike some languages (e.g., Java with checked exceptions), C# does not enforce exception handling at compile time, which can lead to unhandled exceptions at runtime.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile exception handling is essential for robust applications, it should be used judiciously and with an understanding of its limitations. Proper design, resource management, and error handling strategies are necessary to avoid common pitfalls.\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown ### Using Exception Handling for Graceful Degradation in C#\n\n**Graceful degradation** refers to designing software so that when part of it fails, the system continues to operate, possibly with reduced functionality, instead of crashing entirely. In C#, exception handling is a key tool for implementing this.\n\n#### How to Use Exception Handling for Graceful Degradation\n\n1. **Try-Catch Blocks Around Risky Operations**\n   - Enclose code that might fail in a `try` block.\n   - Catch specific exceptions to handle known failure modes.\n\n2. **Fallback Logic in Catch Blocks**\n   - In the `catch` block, provide alternative logic or reduced functionality.\n   - For example, if a database connection fails, switch to reading from a local cache.\n\n3. **Logging and User Notification**\n   - Log the exception details for diagnostics.\n   - Inform the user about the degraded state, if appropriate.\n\n4. **Continue Application Execution**\n   - Ensure the application continues running, even if with limited features.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\npublic string GetUserProfile(int userId)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // Primary operation: fetch from database\n        return FetchProfileFromDatabase(userId);\n    }\n    catch (SqlException ex)\n    {\n        // Log the error\n        LogError(ex);\n\n        // Graceful degradation: fallback to cache\n        try\n        {\n            return FetchProfileFromCache(userId);\n        }\n        catch (Exception cacheEx)\n        {\n            LogError(cacheEx);\n            // Inform the user or return a default profile\n            return \"User profile is temporarily unavailable.\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Avoid catching `Exception` unless necessary; handle only expected failure types.\n- **Fallback Strategies:** Use alternative resources, default values, or disable non-critical features.\n- **User Experience:** Provide meaningful feedback to users about the degraded state.\n- **Logging:** Always log exceptions for future troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\nBy thoughtfully using exception handling, you can ensure your C# applications degrade gracefully, maintaining core functionality and a positive user experience even when errors occur.",

    "question": "How does exception handling interact with async/await in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### How Exception Handling Interacts with `async`/`await` in C#\n\nWhen using `async` and `await` in C#, exception handling works seamlessly with the familiar `try`/`catch` blocks, but with some important nuances:\n\n#### 1. Exceptions in Asynchronous Methods\n\n- If an exception is thrown **before** the first `await` in an `async` method, it behaves like a synchronous exception and is thrown immediately.\n- If an exception is thrown **after** an `await` (or inside a method that is awaited), it is captured and stored in the returned `Task`.\n\n#### 2. Catching Exceptions\n\n- To catch exceptions from an `async` method, you should `await` the method inside a `try`/`catch` block.\n- The exception is re-thrown at the point of the `await` if the task has faulted.\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task DoSomethingAsync()\n{\n    // This exception is thrown immediately\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Oops!\");\n}\n\npublic async Task UseAsyncMethod()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        await DoSomethingAsync();\n    }\n    catch (InvalidOperationException ex)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Caught exception: {ex.Message}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Unobserved Exceptions\n\n- If you call an `async` method but **do not await** its returned `Task`, exceptions may go unobserved and can cause the process to terminate (in .NET 4.5+) or be swallowed.\n- Always `await` your tasks or explicitly observe exceptions via `Task.ContinueWith` or similar mechanisms.\n\n#### 4. AggregateException\n\n- When using `Task.Wait()` or `Task.Result` on a faulted task, exceptions are wrapped in an `AggregateException`.\n- With `await`, the original exception is re-thrown directly, making it easier to handle.\n\n#### 5. Example\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task<int> DivideAsync(int a, int b)\n{\n    await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate async work\n    return a / b; // May throw DivideByZeroException\n}\n\npublic async Task RunAsync()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        int result = await DivideAsync(10, 0);\n    }\n    catch (DivideByZeroException ex)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Cannot divide by zero!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Scenario                           | Exception Handling Behavior                |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Exception before first `await`      | Thrown synchronously                      |\n| Exception after an `await`          | Captured in Task, re-thrown on `await`    |\n| Not awaiting the Task               | Exception may go unobserved               |\n| Using `Task.Wait()`/`Task.Result`   | Exception wrapped in `AggregateException` |\n\n**In summary:**  \nUse `try`/`catch` around `await` statements to handle exceptions from asynchronous methods, and always await your tasks to ensure exceptions are observed and handled properly.\n```\n",

    "question": "What is the difference between Task.Exception and Task.Status in error handling?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n**Task.Exception** and **Task.Status** are both properties of the `Task` class in C#, but they serve different purposes in error handling:\n\n### Task.Exception\n- **Purpose:** Holds the exception(s) that caused the task to fault.\n- **Type:** `AggregateException`\n- **Usage:** Accessed when a task has failed (i.e., is in the `Faulted` state).\n- **Example:**  \n  ```csharp\n  if (myTask.IsFaulted)\n  {\n      Console.WriteLine(myTask.Exception);\n  }\n  ```\n- **Note:** Accessing `Exception` when the task has not faulted returns `null`.\n\n### Task.Status\n- **Purpose:** Indicates the current lifecycle state of the task.\n- **Type:** `TaskStatus` (an enum)\n- **Common Values:** `Created`, `Running`, `RanToCompletion`, `Faulted`, `Canceled`\n- **Usage:** Checked to determine if the task has completed successfully, failed, or was canceled.\n- **Example:**  \n  ```csharp\n  if (myTask.Status == TaskStatus.Faulted)\n  {\n      // Handle the error\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Property         | Purpose                        | Type                | Error Handling Role                    |\n|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| `Task.Exception` | Holds exceptions from failure  | `AggregateException`| Provides details about the error(s)    |\n| `Task.Status`    | Indicates task's state         | `TaskStatus` enum   | Shows if the task failed, succeeded, etc.|\n\n**In summary:**  \nUse `Task.Status` to check if a task has faulted, and use `Task.Exception` to retrieve the exception details when it has.\n```",
