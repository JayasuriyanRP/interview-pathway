        "answer": "```markdown\n## Factory Method Pattern: Interfaces and Base Classes in C#\n\nIn the **Factory Method** pattern, the following interfaces or base classes are typically involved:\n\n1. **Product Interface or Abstract Class**\n   - This defines the interface for objects the factory method creates.\n   - All concrete products implement or inherit from this.\n\n2. **Creator (Factory) Abstract Class or Interface**\n   - Declares the factory method, which returns a product object.\n   - May provide a default implementation that calls the factory method.\n\n3. **ConcreteProduct Classes**\n   - Implement the Product interface or inherit from the Product base class.\n\n4. **ConcreteCreator Classes**\n   - Implement the factory method to return instances of ConcreteProduct.\n\n### Example in C#\n\n```csharp\n// 1. Product Interface\npublic interface IProduct\n{\n    void Operation();\n}\n\n// 2. Concrete Products\npublic class ConcreteProductA : IProduct\n{\n    public void Operation() => Console.WriteLine(\"Product A\");\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteProductB : IProduct\n{\n    public void Operation() => Console.WriteLine(\"Product B\");\n}\n\n// 3. Creator Abstract Class\npublic abstract class Creator\n{\n    // Factory Method\n    public abstract IProduct FactoryMethod();\n\n    public void SomeOperation()\n    {\n        var product = FactoryMethod();\n        product.Operation();\n    }\n}\n\n// 4. Concrete Creators\npublic class ConcreteCreatorA : Creator\n{\n    public override IProduct FactoryMethod() => new ConcreteProductA();\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteCreatorB : Creator\n{\n    public override IProduct FactoryMethod() => new ConcreteProductB();\n}\n```\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Role           | Typical Name         | Example in C#         |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Product        | Interface/Base Class| `IProduct`            |\n| ConcreteProduct| Class               | `ConcreteProductA/B`  |\n| Creator        | Abstract Class      | `Creator`             |\n| ConcreteCreator| Class               | `ConcreteCreatorA/B`  |\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Factory Method pattern typically involves a Product interface/base class and a Creator abstract class/interface, along with their concrete implementations.\n```\n",

        "question": "What are creational design patterns in C# and why are they important?",
        "answer": "```markdown # Creational Design Patterns in C#\n\nCreational design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. In C#, these patterns provide various ways to instantiate objects, making the code more flexible, reusable, and easier to manage.\n\n## Why Are They Important?\n\n- **Encapsulation of object creation logic:** They hide the details of how objects are created, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n- **Promote code reuse:** By centralizing object creation, you avoid duplicating code.\n- **Increase flexibility:** You can change the way objects are created without affecting the rest of the codebase.\n- **Support for complex object creation:** They help manage the creation of complex objects with many dependencies.\n\n## Common Creational Patterns in C#\n\n1. **Singleton Pattern**\n   - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class Singleton\n   {\n       private static Singleton instance;\n       private Singleton() { }\n       public static Singleton Instance\n       {\n           get\n           {\n               if (instance == null)\n                   instance = new Singleton();\n               return instance;\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Factory Method Pattern**\n   - Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public abstract class Product { }\n   public class ConcreteProductA : Product { }\n   public class ConcreteProductB : Product { }\n\n   public abstract class Creator\n   {\n       public abstract Product FactoryMethod();\n   }\n\n   public class ConcreteCreatorA : Creator\n   {\n       public override Product FactoryMethod() => new ConcreteProductA();\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**\n   - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public interface IButton { void Paint(); }\n   public class WinButton : IButton { public void Paint() => Console.WriteLine(\"Windows Button\"); }\n   public class MacButton : IButton { public void Paint() => Console.WriteLine(\"Mac Button\"); }\n\n   public interface IGUIFactory { IButton CreateButton(); }\n   public class WinFactory : IGUIFactory { public IButton CreateButton() => new WinButton(); }\n   public class MacFactory : IGUIFactory { public IButton CreateButton() => new MacButton(); }\n   ```\n\n4. **Builder Pattern**\n   - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class Product\n   {\n       public string PartA { get; set; }\n       public string PartB { get; set; }\n   }\n\n   public interface IBuilder\n   {\n       void BuildPartA();\n       void BuildPartB();\n       Product GetResult();\n   }\n\n   public class ConcreteBuilder : IBuilder\n   {\n       private Product product = new Product();\n       public void BuildPartA() => product.PartA = \"PartA\";\n       public void BuildPartB() => product.PartB = \"PartB\";\n       public Product GetResult() => product;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Prototype Pattern**\n   - Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public class Prototype : ICloneable\n   {\n       public int Value { get; set; }\n       public object Clone()\n       {\n           return this.MemberwiseClone();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Summary\n\nCreational design patterns in C# help manage object creation in a flexible and reusable way. They are important for writing maintainable and scalable code, especially in large applications where object creation can become complex. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype patterns.",

        "answer": "```markdown ## Singleton Pattern in C#\n\nThe **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as a configuration manager or a connection pool.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Only one instance of the class is created.\n- The instance is accessible globally.\n- The constructor is made private to prevent direct instantiation.\n\n### Simple C# Example\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    // Step 1: Create a private static variable to hold the single instance\n    private static Singleton instance;\n\n    // Step 2: Make the constructor private so it cannot be instantiated from outside\n    private Singleton()\n    {\n        // Initialization code here\n    }\n\n    // Step 3: Provide a public static method to get the instance\n    public static Singleton GetInstance()\n    {\n        if (instance == null)\n        {\n            instance = new Singleton();\n        }\n        return instance;\n    }\n\n    // Example method\n    public void ShowMessage()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello from Singleton!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Singleton s1 = Singleton.GetInstance();\n        Singleton s2 = Singleton.GetInstance();\n\n        s1.ShowMessage();\n\n        // Check if both references point to the same instance\n        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(s1, s2)); // Output: True\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `Singleton.GetInstance()` always returns the same instance.\n- The constructor is private, so you cannot create a new instance using `new`.\n- This ensures that only one instance of `Singleton` exists throughout the application.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For multi-threaded applications, consider using thread-safe implementations (e.g., using `lock` or `Lazy<T>`).",

        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s a markdown-formatted answer explaining the difference between the **Factory Method** and **Abstract Factory** patterns in C#, including examples:\n\n---\n\n## Difference Between Factory Method and Abstract Factory in C#\n\nBoth the **Factory Method** and **Abstract Factory** are creational design patterns, but they serve different purposes and have distinct structures.\n\n### 1. Factory Method Pattern\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.\n- **Use Case:** When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create.\n- **Structure:** Typically involves a single method for creating a product.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Product interface\npublic interface IButton\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n\n// Concrete Products\npublic class WindowsButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Windows Button\");\n}\n\npublic class MacButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Mac Button\");\n}\n\n// Creator\npublic abstract class Dialog\n{\n    public abstract IButton CreateButton();\n\n    public void RenderWindow()\n    {\n        var button = CreateButton();\n        button.Render();\n    }\n}\n\n// Concrete Creators\npublic class WindowsDialog : Dialog\n{\n    public override IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n}\n\npublic class MacDialog : Dialog\n{\n    public override IButton CreateButton() => new MacButton();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Abstract Factory Pattern\n\n- **Purpose:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n- **Use Case:** When you need to create multiple related objects (products) that should work together.\n- **Structure:** Involves multiple factory methods, one for each kind of product.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Abstract Products\npublic interface IButton\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n\npublic interface ICheckbox\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n\n// Concrete Products\npublic class WindowsButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Windows Button\");\n}\n\npublic class WindowsCheckbox : ICheckbox\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Windows Checkbox\");\n}\n\npublic class MacButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Mac Button\");\n}\n\npublic class MacCheckbox : ICheckbox\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Mac Checkbox\");\n}\n\n// Abstract Factory\npublic interface IGUIFactory\n{\n    IButton CreateButton();\n    ICheckbox CreateCheckbox();\n}\n\n// Concrete Factories\npublic class WindowsFactory : IGUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => new WindowsCheckbox();\n}\n\npublic class MacFactory : IGUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new MacButton();\n    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => new MacCheckbox();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                | Factory Method             | Abstract Factory                         |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose               | Create one product        | Create families of related products      |\n| Number of Products    | Usually one               | Multiple (family)                        |\n| Structure             | Single factory method     | Multiple factory methods in one interface|\n| Example               | Create a Button           | Create Button and Checkbox together      |\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \n- Use **Factory Method** when you need to create a single product and let subclasses decide which one.\n- Use **Abstract Factory** when you need to create families of related products that should be used together.",

        "answer": "```markdown ## Prototype Pattern in C#\n\nThe **Prototype** pattern is a creational design pattern used to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is expensive or complex. Instead of creating a new instance from scratch, you clone an existing instance.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Cloning**: Objects are created by copying a prototype rather than instantiating a new one.\n- **Shallow vs. Deep Copy**: The pattern can use shallow or deep copying, depending on whether you need to duplicate referenced objects.\n- **Flexibility**: New objects can be created at runtime without depending on their concrete classes.\n\n---\n\n## C# Implementation Example\n\nLet's implement a simple prototype pattern with a `Person` class.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic interface IPrototype<T>\n{\n    T Clone();\n}\n\npublic class Person : IPrototype<Person>\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n\n    // Deep copy implementation\n    public Person Clone()\n    {\n        return new Person\n        {\n            Name = this.Name,\n            Address = new Address\n            {\n                City = this.Address.City,\n                Street = this.Address.Street\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"{Name}, {Address.Street}, {Address.City}\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Address\n{\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    public string City { get; set; }\n}\n\n// Usage\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var original = new Person\n        {\n            Name = \"Alice\",\n            Address = new Address { Street = \"123 Main St\", City = \"Wonderland\" }\n        };\n\n        // Clone the original person\n        var clone = original.Clone();\n        clone.Name = \"Bob\";\n        clone.Address.City = \"Dreamland\";\n\n        Console.WriteLine(original); // Alice, 123 Main St, Wonderland\n        Console.WriteLine(clone);    // Bob, 123 Main St, Dreamland\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **IPrototype<T>**: Interface declaring the `Clone` method.\n- **Person**: Implements the prototype interface and provides a deep copy in `Clone()`.\n- **Address**: A simple class to demonstrate deep copying.\n- **Usage**: We clone the `original` person and modify the clone. The original remains unchanged, demonstrating the effectiveness of the prototype pattern.\n\n---\n\n**When to use:**  \nUse the Prototype pattern when object creation is costly, or you need to avoid subclassing for object creation. It's also helpful when you need to keep the details of object creation hidden from the client.",

        "question": "How can you ensure thread safety in a Singleton implementation in C#?",
        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an intermediate-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## Ensuring Thread Safety in a Singleton Implementation in C#\n\nIn C#, a Singleton ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it. However, in a multithreaded environment, a naive Singleton implementation can lead to multiple instances being created if two threads access the instance at the same time. To ensure thread safety, several approaches can be used:\n\n### 1. **Simple (Non-Thread-Safe) Singleton**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton _instance;\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (_instance == null)\n                _instance = new Singleton();\n            return _instance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*This implementation is **not thread-safe**.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Thread-Safe Singleton using `lock`**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton _instance;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            lock (_lock)\n            {\n                if (_instance == null)\n                    _instance = new Singleton();\n                return _instance;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n- The `lock` ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time.\n- This approach is thread-safe but can have performance overhead due to locking every time `Instance` is accessed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Double-Check Locking**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton _instance;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (_instance == null)\n            {\n                lock (_lock)\n                {\n                    if (_instance == null)\n                        _instance = new Singleton();\n                }\n            }\n            return _instance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n- Reduces the performance overhead by locking only when the instance is `null`.\n- **Note:** In C#, this is safe starting from .NET 2.0 due to memory model improvements.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Eager Initialization (Static Constructor)**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => _instance;\n}\n```\n- The instance is created at the time of type initialization.\n- The .NET runtime ensures thread safety for static initializers.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Lazy<T> Implementation (Recommended in Modern C#)**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> _lazyInstance =\n        new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => _lazyInstance.Value;\n}\n```\n- `Lazy<T>` handles thread safety and lazy initialization internally.\n- This is the **recommended approach** in modern C#.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach                | Thread Safe | Lazy Initialization | Performance |\n|-------------------------|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:-----------:|\n| Simple                  | No          | Yes                 | High        |\n| lock                    | Yes         | Yes                 | Medium      |\n| Double-Check Locking    | Yes         | Yes                 | High        |\n| Static Constructor      | Yes         | No                  | High        |\n| Lazy<T>                 | Yes         | Yes                 | High        |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nTo ensure thread safety in a Singleton implementation in C#, use either the `lock` statement, double-check locking, static constructors, or the `Lazy<T>` type. The `Lazy<T>` approach is generally the most concise and robust for modern applications.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n## Abstract Factory Pattern in C#\n\nThe **Abstract Factory** pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don't want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nSuppose we are building a UI library that supports two themes: **Windows** and **Mac**. Each theme provides its own style of buttons and checkboxes.\n\n### Step 1: Define Abstract Products\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IButton\n{\n    void Paint();\n}\n\npublic interface ICheckbox\n{\n    void Paint();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define Concrete Products\n\n```csharp\n// Windows products\npublic class WindowsButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Paint() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering a Windows Button.\");\n}\n\npublic class WindowsCheckbox : ICheckbox\n{\n    public void Paint() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering a Windows Checkbox.\");\n}\n\n// Mac products\npublic class MacButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Paint() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering a Mac Button.\");\n}\n\npublic class MacCheckbox : ICheckbox\n{\n    public void Paint() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering a Mac Checkbox.\");\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define Abstract Factory\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IGUIFactory\n{\n    IButton CreateButton();\n    ICheckbox CreateCheckbox();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Define Concrete Factories\n\n```csharp\npublic class WindowsFactory : IGUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => new WindowsCheckbox();\n}\n\npublic class MacFactory : IGUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new MacButton();\n    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => new MacCheckbox();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Client Code\n\n```csharp\npublic class Application\n{\n    private readonly IButton _button;\n    private readonly ICheckbox _checkbox;\n\n    public Application(IGUIFactory factory)\n    {\n        _button = factory.CreateButton();\n        _checkbox = factory.CreateCheckbox();\n    }\n\n    public void Paint()\n    {\n        _button.Paint();\n        _checkbox.Paint();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        IGUIFactory factory;\n\n        // Suppose the OS is Windows\n        factory = new WindowsFactory();\n\n        // For Mac, use: factory = new MacFactory();\n\n        var app = new Application(factory);\n        app.Paint();\n\n        // Output:\n        // Rendering a Windows Button.\n        // Rendering a Windows Checkbox.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Abstract Factory pattern allows you to create families of related objects (like buttons and checkboxes) without specifying their concrete classes, making your code more flexible and scalable.\n```\n",

This is especially useful when object creation is costly or complex.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n- The pattern defines an interface (usually with a `Clone` method) for cloning itself.\n- Concrete classes implement this interface, providing logic for deep or shallow copying.\n- Clients use the prototype's `Clone` method to create new objects.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Reduces the cost of creating complex objects.**\n- **Avoids subclassing for object creation.**\n- **Simplifies object creation with dynamic configurations.**\n\n---\n\n### Example in C#\n\nSuppose you have a `Person` class that you want to clone:\n\n```csharp\n// Prototype interface\npublic interface IPrototype<T>\n{\n    T Clone();\n}\n\n// Concrete class implementing the prototype\npublic class Person : IPrototype<Person>\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n\n    // Shallow copy\n    public Person Clone()\n    {\n        return (Person)this.MemberwiseClone();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Person original = new Person { Name = \"Alice\", Age = 30 };\n        Person clone = original.Clone();\n\n        clone.Name = \"Bob\";\n\n        Console.WriteLine(original.Name); // Output: Alice\n        Console.WriteLine(clone.Name);    // Output: Bob\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- The **Prototype pattern** allows you to clone objects without coupling to their specific classes.\n- In C#, you can use interfaces and the `MemberwiseClone()` method for shallow copies, or implement deep copying as needed.\n- This pattern is useful when object creation is expensive or when you need to create copies of objects at runtime.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Prototype pattern in C# helps in cloning objects by providing a standardized way to copy existing instances, making object creation more flexible and efficient.",

        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced explanation and example of implementing a thread-safe Singleton using double-check locking in C#.\n\n---\n\n## Thread-Safe Singleton with Double-Check Locking in C#\n\nThe **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In multithreaded scenarios, you must ensure that only one instance is created even if multiple threads try to access it simultaneously.\n\n**Double-check locking** is a technique to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first checking the locking criterion (in this case, whether the instance is null) without actually acquiring the lock. Only if the instance is null does it acquire the lock.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton _instance = null;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    // Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes\n    private Singleton()\n    {\n        // Initialization code here\n    }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (_instance == null) // First check (no locking)\n            {\n                lock (_lock) // Lock only if instance is null\n                {\n                    if (_instance == null) // Second check (with locking)\n                    {\n                        _instance = new Singleton();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return _instance;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Example method\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Singleton instance is working.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Singleton s1 = Singleton.Instance;\n        Singleton s2 = Singleton.Instance;\n\n        s1.DoSomething();\n\n        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(s1, s2)); // Output: True\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `Instance` property checks if `_instance` is `null` before entering the lock (first check).\n- If `_instance` is still `null` after acquiring the lock (second check), it creates the instance.\n- The `volatile` keyword is not strictly necessary in C# for reference types due to memory model guarantees since .NET 2.0, but can be added for extra safety in older environments.\n- This approach ensures that locking only occurs on the first access, minimizing performance overhead.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nFor most modern C# applications, you can use the simpler [Lazy<T>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.lazy-1) approach for thread-safe singletons, but double-check locking is a classic and interview-favorite technique.",

        "question": "How can dependency injection be used with creational patterns in C#?",
        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## How Can Dependency Injection Be Used with Creational Patterns in C#?\n\nDependency Injection (DI) is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It allows you to inject dependencies (objects) into a class, rather than the class creating them directly. This is particularly useful when combined with creational design patterns, such as **Factory**, **Abstract Factory**, **Builder**, and **Singleton**, to enhance flexibility, testability, and maintainability.\n\n### 1. Using DI with Factory Pattern\n\nThe Factory pattern encapsulates object creation logic. By combining it with DI, you can inject a factory interface into consumers, decoupling them from concrete implementations.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Product interface\npublic interface IProduct\n{\n    void DoWork();\n}\n\n// Concrete Product\npublic class ConcreteProduct : IProduct\n{\n    public void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine(\"ConcreteProduct working.\");\n}\n\n// Factory interface\npublic interface IProductFactory\n{\n    IProduct CreateProduct();\n}\n\n// Concrete Factory\npublic class ConcreteProductFactory : IProductFactory\n{\n    public IProduct CreateProduct() => new ConcreteProduct();\n}\n\n// Consumer class\npublic class ProductConsumer\n{\n    private readonly IProductFactory _factory;\n\n    public ProductConsumer(IProductFactory factory)\n    {\n        _factory = factory;\n    }\n\n    public void Run()\n    {\n        var product = _factory.CreateProduct();\n        product.DoWork();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Registering with DI (e.g., in ASP.NET Core):**\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddTransient<IProductFactory, ConcreteProductFactory>();\nservices.AddTransient<ProductConsumer>();\n```\n\n### 2. Using DI with Singleton Pattern\n\nSingleton ensures a class has only one instance. In DI containers, you can register a service as a singleton, letting the container manage its lifecycle.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ILogger\n{\n    void Log(string message);\n}\n\npublic class ConsoleLogger : ILogger\n{\n    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);\n}\n\n// Register as singleton\nservices.AddSingleton<ILogger, ConsoleLogger>();\n```\n\nNow, any class that depends on `ILogger` will receive the same instance.\n\n### 3. Using DI with Abstract Factory Pattern\n\nAbstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related objects. With DI, you can inject the abstract factory into clients.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IUIFactory\n{\n    IButton CreateButton();\n    ITextBox CreateTextBox();\n}\n\npublic class WindowsUIFactory : IUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n    public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new WindowsTextBox();\n}\n\n// Register factory\nservices.AddTransient<IUIFactory, WindowsUIFactory>();\n```\n\n### 4. Using DI with Builder Pattern\n\nThe Builder pattern constructs complex objects step by step. You can inject a builder interface into consumers.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IReportBuilder\n{\n    void BuildHeader();\n    void BuildBody();\n    Report GetReport();\n}\n\npublic class PdfReportBuilder : IReportBuilder\n{\n    // Implementation omitted for brevity\n}\n\n// Register builder\nservices.AddTransient<IReportBuilder, PdfReportBuilder>();\n```\n\n### **Benefits of Combining DI with Creational Patterns**\n\n- **Decoupling:** Consumers depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.\n- **Testability:** Easily substitute mock implementations for testing.\n- **Configurability:** Swap implementations via DI configuration.\n- **Lifecycle Management:** DI container manages object lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient).\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nDependency Injection complements creational patterns by externalizing the creation and management of dependencies, promoting loose coupling and easier testing in C# applications. This synergy is especially powerful in modern frameworks like ASP.NET Core, where DI is built-in.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Difference Between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy in the Prototype Pattern (C#)\n\nIn the **Prototype** design pattern, objects are cloned to create new instances. The way cloning is performed—**shallow copy** vs **deep copy**—determines how the object's fields are duplicated.\n\n#### Shallow Copy\n\n- **Definition:** Copies the object's immediate values. If a field is a reference type, only the reference is copied, not the actual object it points to.\n- **Implication:** Both the original and the clone share references to the same objects for reference-type fields.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Address\n{\n    public string City { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Person : ICloneable\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n\n    // Shallow copy\n    public object Clone()\n    {\n        return this.MemberwiseClone();\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar person1 = new Person { Name = \"Alice\", Address = new Address { City = \"New York\" } };\nvar person2 = (Person)person1.Clone();\nperson2.Address.City = \"London\";\n\nConsole.WriteLine(person1.Address.City); // Output: \"London\"\n```\n*Changing `person2.Address.City` also changes `person1.Address.City` because they share the same Address object.*\n\n---\n\n#### Deep Copy\n\n- **Definition:** Copies the object and all objects referenced by its fields recursively. Each reference-type field gets a new copy.\n- **Implication:** The original and the clone are completely independent, including all nested objects.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Address\n{\n    public string City { get; set; }\n\n    public Address Clone()\n    {\n        return new Address { City = this.City };\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Person : ICloneable\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n\n    // Deep copy\n    public object Clone()\n    {\n        return new Person\n        {\n            Name = this.Name,\n            Address = this.Address.Clone()\n        };\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar person1 = new Person { Name = \"Alice\", Address = new Address { City = \"New York\" } };\nvar person2 = (Person)person1.Clone();\nperson2.Address.City = \"London\";\n\nConsole.WriteLine(person1.Address.City); // Output: \"New York\"\n```\n*Changing `person2.Address.City` does NOT affect `person1.Address.City` because they have separate Address objects.*\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect         | Shallow Copy                  | Deep Copy                      |\n|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Reference Copy | Yes (references shared)       | No (new objects created)       |\n| Independence   | Not fully independent         | Fully independent              |\n| Implementation | `MemberwiseClone()`           | Custom clone logic required    |\n\n---\n\n**In the Prototype pattern, choose deep copy if you need completely independent objects, especially when your objects contain references to other mutable objects.**\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ### How the Abstract Factory Pattern Promotes Loose Coupling in C# Applications\n\nThe **Abstract Factory** pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is especially useful when your code needs to work with various families of products, but you don't want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products.\n\n#### How It Promotes Loose Coupling\n\n- **Separation of Concerns:** The client code interacts with interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations. This means the client is decoupled from the specific classes that implement the products.\n- **Easier Maintenance and Extension:** You can introduce new product families or change existing ones without modifying the client code.\n- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules (client code) depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.\n\n#### Example in C#\n\nSuppose you are building a UI library that supports multiple themes (e.g., Light and Dark). Each theme provides its own style of buttons and textboxes.\n\n```csharp\n// Abstract product interfaces\npublic interface IButton\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n\npublic interface ITextBox\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n\n// Concrete products for Light theme\npublic class LightButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Light Button\");\n}\n\npublic class LightTextBox : ITextBox\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Light TextBox\");\n}\n\n// Concrete products for Dark theme\npublic class DarkButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Dark Button\");\n}\n\npublic class DarkTextBox : ITextBox\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Dark TextBox\");\n}\n\n// Abstract Factory\npublic interface IUIFactory\n{\n    IButton CreateButton();\n    ITextBox CreateTextBox();\n}\n\n// Concrete Factories\npublic class LightUIFactory : IUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new LightButton();\n    public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new LightTextBox();\n}\n\npublic class DarkUIFactory : IUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new DarkButton();\n    public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new DarkTextBox();\n}\n\n// Client code\npublic class Application\n{\n    private readonly IButton _button;\n    private readonly ITextBox _textBox;\n\n    public Application(IUIFactory factory)\n    {\n        _button = factory.CreateButton();\n        _textBox = factory.CreateTextBox();\n    }\n\n    public void RenderUI()\n    {\n        _button.Render();\n        _textBox.Render();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        IUIFactory factory = new DarkUIFactory(); // Can switch to LightUIFactory easily\n        Application app = new Application(factory);\n        app.RenderUI();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- The `Application` class depends only on the `IUIFactory`, `IButton`, and `ITextBox` interfaces.\n- To switch themes, you only need to change the factory implementation passed to the `Application`—no changes are required in the client code.\n- This decoupling makes the codebase more flexible and maintainable.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Abstract Factory pattern promotes loose coupling in C# by ensuring that client code works with interfaces or abstract classes, not concrete implementations. This allows for easy substitution of product families and enhances the flexibility and scalability of your application.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Potential Drawbacks of Using the Singleton Pattern in Multithreaded Applications\n\nThe Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. While this can be useful, it introduces several potential drawbacks in multithreaded C# applications:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Thread Safety Issues**\n\nIf not implemented correctly, multiple threads could create multiple instances of the Singleton, violating its core principle.\n\n**Example (Non-thread-safe Singleton):**\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton instance;\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (instance == null)\n            {\n                instance = new Singleton(); // Not thread-safe!\n            }\n            return instance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*If two threads access `Instance` at the same time, both could create a new instance.*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Performance Overhead with Locks**\n\nTo ensure thread safety, developers often use locks, which can introduce performance bottlenecks, especially if the Singleton is accessed frequently.\n\n**Example (Thread-safe with Lock):**\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton instance;\n    private static readonly object lockObj = new object();\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            lock (lockObj)\n            {\n                if (instance == null)\n                {\n                    instance = new Singleton();\n                }\n                return instance;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*Every call to `Instance` acquires a lock, potentially slowing down the application.*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Complexity with Double-Checked Locking**\n\nTo reduce locking overhead, double-checked locking is used, but it's easy to get wrong and can introduce subtle bugs if not implemented correctly.\n\n**Example (Double-Checked Locking):**\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton instance;\n    private static readonly object lockObj = new object();\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (instance == null)\n            {\n                lock (lockObj)\n                {\n                    if (instance == null)\n                    {\n                        instance = new Singleton();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return instance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*Prior to .NET 2.0, this pattern was not guaranteed to work due to memory model issues.*\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Difficulties in Unit Testing**\n\nSingletons introduce global state, making unit testing and mocking challenging, especially in parallel test execution.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Hidden Dependencies**\n\nSingletons can act as hidden dependencies, making code harder to understand, maintain, and refactor, especially in concurrent scenarios.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Resource Management**\n\nIf the Singleton holds resources (e.g., file handles, database connections), improper handling in a multithreaded context can lead to resource contention or leaks.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Practice**\n\nIn C#, the recommended approach is to use the static constructor, which is thread-safe and lazy by default:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Singleton instance = new Singleton();\n\n    static Singleton() { }\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => instance;\n}\n```\n\nOr, for lazy initialization:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> lazy =\n        new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => lazy.Value;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Drawback                        | Description                                               |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Thread Safety Issues             | Multiple instances may be created in multithreaded code  |\n| Performance Overhead             | Locking can slow down access                             |\n| Complexity                      | Double-checked locking is error-prone                    |\n| Testing Difficulty               | Global state complicates unit testing                    |\n| Hidden Dependencies              | Harder to track and manage dependencies                  |\n| Resource Management              | Risk of contention or leaks with shared resources        |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nWhile Singleton is a useful pattern, it requires careful implementation in multithreaded C# applications to avoid subtle bugs and performance issues.

This makes it an excellent choice for implementing the Singleton pattern in C#.\n\nBelow is an example of a thread-safe Singleton implementation using `Lazy<T>`:\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    // The Lazy<T> instance ensures lazy, thread-safe initialization\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> lazyInstance =\n        new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());\n\n    // Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes\n    private Singleton()\n    {\n        // Initialization code here\n    }\n\n    // Public static property to access the Singleton instance\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return lazyInstance.Value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Example method\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Singleton instance is working!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Singleton s1 = Singleton.Instance;\n        Singleton s2 = Singleton.Instance;\n\n        s1.DoSomething();\n\n        // Outputs 'True' because both variables reference the same instance\n        Console.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(s1, s2));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- `Lazy<T>` ensures that the Singleton instance is created only when it is first accessed.\n- The default `LazyThreadSafetyMode` is `ExecutionAndPublication`, which is thread-safe.\n- The constructor is private to prevent external instantiation.\n- The Singleton instance is accessed via the static `Instance` property.\n\nThis approach is concise, efficient, and recommended for implementing Singletons in modern C#.",

        "question": "How do you implement cloning in C# for the Prototype pattern when the object contains reference types?",
        "answer": "```markdown ### Implementing Cloning in C# for the Prototype Pattern (with Reference Types)\n\nThe **Prototype** pattern allows you to create new objects by copying existing ones (prototypes), rather than instantiating new objects from scratch. In C#, implementing this pattern requires careful handling of **reference types** to ensure correct cloning behavior.\n\n#### Shallow vs. Deep Copy\n\n- **Shallow Copy:** Copies the object's fields as-is. Reference fields will point to the same objects as the original.\n- **Deep Copy:** Copies the object and all objects referenced by its fields, recursively.\n\nFor the Prototype pattern, **deep copying** is usually preferred when reference types are involved, to avoid unintended side effects.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Implementing Deep Cloning\n\nSuppose you have the following classes:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Address\n{\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    public string City { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Person : ICloneable\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n\n    // Deep clone implementation\n    public object Clone()\n    {\n        // Create a shallow copy first\n        Person clone = (Person)this.MemberwiseClone();\n\n        // Manually deep clone the reference type\n        clone.Address = new Address\n        {\n            Street = this.Address.Street,\n            City = this.Address.City\n        };\n\n        return clone;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```csharp\nvar original = new Person\n{\n    Name = \"Alice\",\n    Address = new Address { Street = \"123 Main St\", City = \"Metropolis\" }\n};\n\nvar copy = (Person)original.Clone();\ncopy.Name = \"Bob\";\ncopy.Address.City = \"Gotham\";\n\n// original.Address.City is still \"Metropolis\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Implement `ICloneable`** or define your own `Clone` method.\n- Use `MemberwiseClone()` for a shallow copy, then manually clone reference-type fields for a deep copy.\n- If your object graph is complex, consider using serialization for deep cloning (e.g., with `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json`), but be aware of performance and type constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Using Serialization for Deep Cloning\n\n```csharp\npublic static T DeepClone<T>(T obj)\n{\n    var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj);\n    return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(json);\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** This approach requires all involved types to be serializable and may not handle all scenarios (e.g., circular references).\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Approach           | Pros                  | Cons                       |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| Manual Deep Clone  | Precise, performant   | Tedious for large graphs   |\n| Serialization      | Easy, generic         | Slower, needs serializable types |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo implement the Prototype pattern in C# with reference types, ensure you perform a **deep copy** of reference fields in your `Clone` method. This prevents shared references and maintains object integrity. Use manual cloning for control, or serialization for convenience.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Role of the Director Class in the Builder Pattern**\n\nIn the Builder design pattern, the **Director** class is responsible for managing the construction process of a complex object. It does not create the object directly but delegates the building steps to a **Builder** interface. The Director knows the sequence in which to call the builder methods to construct the final product, ensuring that the construction process is consistent and controlled.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- The Director encapsulates the algorithm for assembling a product.\n- It works with a Builder object to construct a product step by step.\n- The Director is optional but useful when the construction process is complex or needs to be reused.\n\n---\n\n### C# Example\n\nSuppose we want to build a `Car` object with different configurations.\n\n#### 1. Product\n\n```csharp\npublic class Car\n{\n    public string Engine { get; set; }\n    public string Wheels { get; set; }\n    public string Body { get; set; }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"Engine: {Engine}, Wheels: {Wheels}, Body: {Body}\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Builder Interface\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ICarBuilder\n{\n    void BuildEngine();\n    void BuildWheels();\n    void BuildBody();\n    Car GetCar();\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Concrete Builder\n\n```csharp\npublic class SportsCarBuilder : ICarBuilder\n{\n    private Car _car = new Car();\n\n    public void BuildEngine() => _car.Engine = \"V8 Engine\";\n    public void BuildWheels() => _car.Wheels = \"18 inch Alloy Wheels\";\n    public void BuildBody() => _car.Body = \"Sleek Body\";\n\n    public Car GetCar() => _car;\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Director\n\n```csharp\npublic class Director\n{\n    private ICarBuilder _builder;\n\n    public Director(ICarBuilder builder)\n    {\n        _builder = builder;\n    }\n\n    public void ConstructCar()\n    {\n        _builder.BuildEngine();\n        _builder.BuildWheels();\n        _builder.BuildBody();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Usage\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        ICarBuilder builder = new SportsCarBuilder();\n        Director director = new Director(builder);\n\n        director.ConstructCar();\n        Car car = builder.GetCar();\n\n        Console.WriteLine(car);\n        // Output: Engine: V8 Engine, Wheels: 18 inch Alloy Wheels, Body: Sleek Body\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Director class in the Builder pattern orchestrates the construction of a complex object by specifying the order in which to call the builder methods. This separates the construction logic from the representation, making the code more modular and flexible.",

        "answer": "```markdown The **Factory Method** pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is closely aligned with the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n\n## How Factory Method Adheres to the Open/Closed Principle\n\n- **Open for Extension**: You can introduce new product types (classes) without changing the existing code that uses the factory.\n- **Closed for Modification**: The core logic of the factory and client code does not need to be modified when new product types are added; you simply extend the factory.\n\n### Example in C#\n\nSuppose you have a system that creates different types of documents.\n\n#### Step 1: Define the Product Interface\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IDocument\n{\n    void Print();\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Products\n\n```csharp\npublic class WordDocument : IDocument\n{\n    public void Print() => Console.WriteLine(\"Printing Word document...\");\n}\n\npublic class PdfDocument : IDocument\n{\n    public void Print() => Console.WriteLine(\"Printing PDF document...\");\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Create the Factory\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class DocumentFactory\n{\n    public abstract IDocument CreateDocument();\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Factories\n\n```csharp\npublic class WordDocumentFactory : DocumentFactory\n{\n    public override IDocument CreateDocument() => new WordDocument();\n}\n\npublic class PdfDocumentFactory : DocumentFactory\n{\n    public override IDocument CreateDocument() => new PdfDocument();\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Client Code\n\n```csharp\npublic class Client\n{\n    public void PrintDocument(DocumentFactory factory)\n    {\n        IDocument doc = factory.CreateDocument();\n        doc.Print();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Adding a New Document Type\n\nTo add a new document type (e.g., `ExcelDocument`), you simply:\n\n1.

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Difference Between Static Classes and Singleton Pattern in C#\n\nBoth **static classes** and the **Singleton pattern** are used to ensure that only one instance of a class exists in a C# application. However, they have key differences in their design and usage:\n\n#### 1. Static Classes\n\n- **Definition:** A static class cannot be instantiated or inherited. All its members must be static.\n- **Usage:** Used for grouping utility or helper methods that do not require object state.\n- **Memory:** Loaded once in memory and cannot maintain state between calls (unless using static fields).\n- **Inheritance:** Cannot implement interfaces or inherit from other classes.\n- **Example:**\n\n    ```csharp\n    public static class MathHelper\n    {\n        public static int Add(int a, int b)\n        {\n            return a + b;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Usage:**\n    ```csharp\n    int sum = MathHelper.Add(3, 4);\n    ```\n\n#### 2.

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Preventing Inheritance of a Singleton Class in C#\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the Singleton pattern in C#, it's important to prevent other classes from inheriting the Singleton class. If inheritance is allowed, subclasses could create additional instances, breaking the Singleton guarantee.\n\n#### **How to Prevent Inheritance**\n\nIn C#, you can prevent inheritance by marking the Singleton class as `sealed`. A `sealed` class cannot be inherited.\n\n#### **Example**\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();\n\n    // Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get { return _instance; }\n    }\n\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Singleton instance method called.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- The `sealed` keyword prevents any class from inheriting from `Singleton`.\n- The constructor is `private`, so no external instantiation is possible.\n- The static property `Instance` provides the single, globally accessible instance.\n\n#### **Attempting Inheritance (Will Fail)**\n\n```csharp\n// This will cause a compile-time error:\n// 'DerivedSingleton': cannot derive from sealed type 'Singleton'\npublic class DerivedSingleton : Singleton\n{\n}\n```\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Technique         | Purpose                        |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| `sealed` keyword  | Prevents inheritance          |\n| `private` ctor    | Prevents external instantiation|\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy marking your Singleton class as `sealed`, you ensure that no other class can inherit from it, thus preserving the Singleton pattern's constraints in C#.\n```\n",

Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n### Real-World Scenario for Using the Builder Pattern in C#\n\nThe **Builder** pattern is ideal when constructing complex objects that require multiple steps or configurations. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.\n\n#### Scenario: Building a Complex Report\n\nImagine you are developing a reporting system for a business application. Reports can be generated in various formats (PDF, Excel, HTML), and each report may include optional sections such as headers, footers, charts, tables, and summaries. The construction of a report is complex and can vary greatly depending on user requirements.\n\n##### Why Builder is Preferable\n\n- **Complex Construction:** The report has many optional parts and configurations.\n- **Step-by-Step Construction:** The process involves multiple steps (add header, add data, add charts, etc.).\n- **Different Representations:** The same report data can be represented in different formats (PDF, Excel, HTML).\n- **Separation of Concerns:** The construction logic is separated from the representation.\n\n##### Example in C#\n\n```csharp\n// Product\npublic class Report\n{\n    public string Header { get; set; }\n    public string Content { get; set; }\n    public string Footer { get; set; }\n    // Other sections...\n}\n\n// Builder Interface\npublic interface IReportBuilder\n{\n    void BuildHeader();\n    void BuildContent();\n    void BuildFooter();\n    Report GetReport();\n}\n\n// Concrete Builder for PDF\npublic class PdfReportBuilder : IReportBuilder\n{\n    private Report _report = new Report();\n\n    public void BuildHeader() => _report.Header = \"PDF Header\";\n    public void BuildContent() => _report.Content = \"PDF Content\";\n    public void BuildFooter() => _report.Footer = \"PDF Footer\";\n    public Report GetReport() => _report;\n}\n\n// Director\npublic class ReportDirector\n{\n    private IReportBuilder _builder;\n\n    public ReportDirector(IReportBuilder builder)\n    {\n        _builder = builder;\n    }\n\n    public void ConstructReport()\n    {\n        _builder.BuildHeader();\n        _builder.BuildContent();\n        _builder.BuildFooter();\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar builder = new PdfReportBuilder();\nvar director = new ReportDirector(builder);\ndirector.ConstructReport();\nReport pdfReport = builder.GetReport();\n```\n\n#### Why Not Other Patterns?\n\n- **Factory Method/Abstract Factory:** These are better for creating families of related objects, not for assembling complex objects step by step.\n- **Prototype:** Used for cloning objects, not for stepwise construction.\n- **Singleton:** Ensures a single instance, not related to object construction.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Builder pattern is preferable in scenarios where you need to construct complex objects with many optional parts and different representations, such as generating customizable reports in various formats.",

        "answer": "```markdown # What is the Role of Interfaces in Implementing Creational Patterns in C#?\n\nInterfaces play a crucial role in implementing creational design patterns in C#. They help achieve loose coupling, flexibility, and scalability in object creation. Here’s how:\n\n## 1. **Abstraction**\nInterfaces define a contract for the objects that creational patterns will create. This allows the client code to depend on abstractions rather than concrete classes.\n\n## 2. **Decoupling**\nBy programming to interfaces, creational patterns (like Factory, Abstract Factory, and Builder) decouple the client code from the specific classes that need to be instantiated.\n\n## 3. **Flexibility**\nInterfaces make it easy to introduce new implementations without changing the client code or the creational logic.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Factory Method Pattern\n\nSuppose you have an interface `IProduct` and two concrete classes `ProductA` and `ProductB`.\n\n```csharp\n// Interface\npublic interface IProduct\n{\n    void DoWork();\n}\n\n// Concrete Implementations\npublic class ProductA : IProduct\n{\n    public void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine(\"ProductA is working\");\n}\n\npublic class ProductB : IProduct\n{\n    public void DoWork() => Console.WriteLine(\"ProductB is working\");\n}\n\n// Factory\npublic class ProductFactory\n{\n    public static IProduct CreateProduct(string type)\n    {\n        if (type == \"A\")\n            return new ProductA();\n        else if (type == \"B\")\n            return new ProductB();\n        else\n            throw new ArgumentException(\"Invalid type\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        IProduct product = ProductFactory.CreateProduct(\"A\");\n        product.DoWork(); // Output: ProductA is working\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**In this example:**\n- The `IProduct` interface allows the factory to return different product types without the client knowing the concrete class.\n- The client code interacts only with the `IProduct` interface, promoting loose coupling.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Creational Pattern | Role of Interface                      |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Factory Method     | Defines product contract                |\n| Abstract Factory   | Defines family of product contracts     |\n| Builder            | Defines steps to build a product        |\n| Prototype          | Defines cloning contract                |\n| Singleton          | Less common, but can use interface for testability |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nInterfaces in creational patterns provide abstraction, decoupling, and flexibility, making your code easier to maintain and extend.",

        "question": "How does the Factory Method pattern help in achieving code extensibility?",
        "answer": "```markdown The **Factory Method** pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern helps achieve code extensibility by decoupling the client code from the concrete classes it needs to instantiate.\n\n## How Factory Method Achieves Extensibility\n\n- **Decouples Object Creation:** The client code relies on an abstract creator and product, not on concrete implementations. This means new product types can be introduced without modifying existing client code.\n- **Open/Closed Principle:** You can introduce new product classes and corresponding factory subclasses without changing existing code, making the system open for extension but closed for modification.\n- **Single Responsibility:** The responsibility of instantiating objects is moved to subclasses, keeping the client code focused on its primary logic.\n\n## Example in C#\n\nSuppose you are developing a notification system that can send different types of notifications (Email, SMS). You want to make it easy to add new notification types in the future.\n\n```csharp\n// Product Interface\npublic interface INotification\n{\n    void Notify(string message);\n}\n\n// Concrete Products\npublic class EmailNotification : INotification\n{\n    public void Notify(string message)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Email: \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SmsNotification : INotification\n{\n    public void Notify(string message)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"SMS: \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\n// Creator (Factory)\npublic abstract class NotificationFactory\n{\n    public abstract INotification CreateNotification();\n}\n\n// Concrete Factories\npublic class EmailNotificationFactory : NotificationFactory\n{\n    public override INotification CreateNotification()\n    {\n        return new EmailNotification();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SmsNotificationFactory : NotificationFactory\n{\n    public override INotification CreateNotification()\n    {\n        return new SmsNotification();\n    }\n}\n\n// Client Code\npublic class NotificationService\n{\n    private NotificationFactory _factory;\n\n    public NotificationService(NotificationFactory factory)\n    {\n        _factory = factory;\n    }\n\n    public void Send(string message)\n    {\n        var notification = _factory.CreateNotification();\n        notification.Notify(message);\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        NotificationService emailService = new NotificationService(new EmailNotificationFactory());\n        emailService.Send(\"Hello via Email!\");\n\n        NotificationService smsService = new NotificationService(new SmsNotificationFactory());\n        smsService.Send(\"Hello via SMS!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Extending the System\n\nTo add a new notification type (e.g., PushNotification):\n\n1. Implement a new `PushNotification` class.\n2. Create a `PushNotificationFactory` subclass.\n3. Use the new factory in the client code.\n\nNo changes are needed in the existing factories or client logic.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Factory Method pattern enables code extensibility by allowing new product types to be introduced with minimal changes to existing code. It achieves this by delegating the instantiation logic to subclasses, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle and promoting maintainable, scalable code.",

        "answer": "```markdown ## Common Pitfalls When Implementing the Singleton Pattern in C#\n\nThe Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. While it's a straightforward pattern, there are several common pitfalls when implementing it in C#:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Lack of Thread Safety**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nA naive implementation is not thread-safe. Multiple threads can create multiple instances simultaneously.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton instance;\n    private Singleton() { }\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (instance == null)\n                instance = new Singleton();\n            return instance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*If two threads access `Instance` at the same time, both could create a new Singleton.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Using Locks Inefficiently**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nLocking every time the instance is accessed can degrade performance.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton instance;\n    private static readonly object lockObj = new object();\n    private Singleton() { }\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            lock (lockObj)\n            {\n                if (instance == null)\n                    instance = new Singleton();\n                return instance;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*This is thread-safe, but the lock is acquired every time, even after the instance is created.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Double-Checked Locking Issues**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nIncorrect double-checked locking can still be unsafe without proper memory barriers.\n\n**Correct Example:**\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    private static Singleton instance;\n    private static readonly object lockObj = new object();\n    private Singleton() { }\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (instance == null)\n            {\n                lock (lockObj)\n                {\n                    if (instance == null)\n                        instance = new Singleton();\n                }\n            }\n            return instance;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n*In C#, this works correctly since .NET 2.0 due to memory model guarantees, but it's still more complex than necessary.*\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Not Handling Serialization**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nSerialization can create a new instance, breaking the singleton guarantee.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\n[Serializable]\npublic class Singleton\n{\n    // ... implementation ...\n}\n```\n*Deserializing this class can create a new instance.*\n\n**Solution:**  \nImplement `ISerializable` and use `GetObjectData` and a special method to return the existing instance.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Reflection Can Break Singleton**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nReflection can invoke the private constructor and create new instances.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThrow an exception in the constructor if an instance already exists, or use other safeguards.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Not Using Lazy Initialization Properly**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nEager initialization can create the instance even if it's never used.\n\n**Better Approach:**\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> lazy =\n        new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());\n    private Singleton() { }\n    public static Singleton Instance => lazy.Value;\n}\n```\n*This is thread-safe, lazy, and efficient.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Making Singleton Too Complex**\n\n**Pitfall:**  \nAdding too much logic or state to the singleton can make it hard to test and maintain.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Pitfall                        | Description                                   | Solution                                  |\n|------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Lack of Thread Safety          | Multiple instances in multithreaded context   | Use `Lazy<T>` or proper locking            |\n| Inefficient Locking            | Performance hit due to unnecessary locks      | Use double-check locking or `Lazy<T>`      |\n| Serialization Issues           | New instance via deserialization              | Implement `ISerializable`                  |\n| Reflection Issues              | New instance via reflection                   | Guard constructor                          |\n| Eager Initialization           | Instance created even if unused               | Use lazy initialization                    |\n| Overcomplicating Singleton     | Hard to test and maintain                     | Keep singleton simple                      |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice Example**\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> lazy =\n        new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => lazy.Value;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhen implementing the Singleton pattern in C#, always consider thread safety, lazy initialization, serialization, and reflection.

The challenge is to ensure that deserialization returns the existing Singleton instance.\n\n---\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo maintain the Singleton property during serialization and deserialization, you can implement the `ISerializable` interface and use the `IObjectReference` interface’s `GetRealObject` method.\n\n##### Steps:\n\n1. **Implement `ISerializable`**: Customize the serialization process.\n2. **Implement `IObjectReference`**: Control the object returned during deserialization.\n\n---\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;\nusing System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;\nusing System.IO;\n\n[Serializable]\npublic sealed class Singleton : ISerializable, IObjectReference\n{\n    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => _instance;\n\n    // Private constructor\n    private Singleton()\n    {\n        // Initialization code\n    }\n\n    // ISerializable implementation\n    private Singleton(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)\n    {\n        // No fields to deserialize, as Singleton has no state\n    }\n\n    public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)\n    {\n        // No fields to serialize, as Singleton has no state\n    }\n\n    // IObjectReference implementation\n    public object GetRealObject(StreamingContext context)\n    {\n        // Always return the singleton instance\n        return Instance;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Singleton s1 = Singleton.Instance;\n\n        // Serialize\n        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();\n            formatter.Serialize(ms, s1);\n\n            ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n\n            // Deserialize\n            Singleton s2 = (Singleton)formatter.Deserialize(ms);\n\n            Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(s1, s2)); // True\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Explanation\n\n- **Serialization**: The `GetObjectData` method is required by `ISerializable` but does nothing here because the Singleton has no state.\n- **Deserialization**: The constructor with `SerializationInfo` is called, but the crucial part is `GetRealObject`, which ensures that the deserialized object is always the Singleton instance.\n- **Result**: `ReferenceEquals(s1, s2)` returns `True`, preserving the Singleton property.\n\n---\n\n#### Notes\n\n- This approach works with binary serialization. For other serializers (e.g., JSON), you may need custom converters.\n- If your Singleton has state, serialize/deserialize only the state, not the instance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy implementing `ISerializable` and `IObjectReference`, you can serialize and deserialize a Singleton in C# without breaking its Singleton property.",

The Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating these families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n\n- **Product Family**: A set of products (objects) that are meant to be used together, often because they share a common theme or are designed to be compatible.\n- **Abstract Factory**: Declares creation methods for each product in the family.\n- **Concrete Factory**: Implements the creation methods to produce specific variants of the product family.\n- **Abstract Product**: Declares an interface for a type of product.\n- **Concrete Product**: Implements the abstract product interface.\n\n#### Example Scenario\n\nSuppose you are designing a UI library that supports multiple themes (e.g., Windows and Mac).

It uses a builder object to construct the product step by step.\n- **Product:**  \n  The complex object being built.\n\nThis separation allows you to use the same construction process (in the `Director`) to create different representations (via different concrete builders).\n\n## Example in C#\n\nLet's say we want to build different types of `House` objects (e.g., wooden house, stone house):\n\n```csharp\n// Product\npublic class House\n{\n    public string Walls { get; set; }\n    public string Roof { get; set; }\n    public string Doors { get; set; }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"Walls: {Walls}, Roof: {Roof}, Doors: {Doors}\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Builder Interface\npublic interface IHouseBuilder\n{\n    void BuildWalls();\n    void BuildRoof();\n    void BuildDoors();\n    House GetResult();\n}\n\n// Concrete Builder 1\npublic class WoodenHouseBuilder : IHouseBuilder\n{\n    private House house = new House();\n\n    public void BuildWalls() => house.Walls = \"Wooden Walls\";\n    public void BuildRoof() => house.Roof = \"Wooden Roof\";\n    public void BuildDoors() => house.Doors = \"Wooden Doors\";\n    public House GetResult() => house;\n}\n\n// Concrete Builder 2\npublic class StoneHouseBuilder : IHouseBuilder\n{\n    private House house = new House();\n\n    public void BuildWalls() => house.Walls = \"Stone Walls\";\n    public void BuildRoof() => house.Roof = \"Stone Roof\";\n    public void BuildDoors() => house.Doors = \"Stone Doors\";\n    public House GetResult() => house;\n}\n\n// Director\npublic class HouseDirector\n{\n    public void Construct(IHouseBuilder builder)\n    {\n        builder.BuildWalls();\n        builder.BuildRoof();\n        builder.BuildDoors();\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var director = new HouseDirector();\n\n        IHouseBuilder woodenBuilder = new WoodenHouseBuilder();\n        director.Construct(woodenBuilder);\n        House woodenHouse = woodenBuilder.GetResult();\n        Console.WriteLine(woodenHouse);\n\n        IHouseBuilder stoneBuilder = new StoneHouseBuilder();\n        director.Construct(stoneBuilder);\n        House stoneHouse = stoneBuilder.GetResult();\n        Console.WriteLine(stoneHouse);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nWalls: Wooden Walls, Roof: Wooden Roof, Doors: Wooden Doors\nWalls: Stone Walls, Roof: Stone Roof, Doors: Stone Doors\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n- The **construction process** is handled by the `Director` and is the same for all houses.\n- The **representation** (wooden or stone house) is determined by the specific builder used.\n- This separation makes it easy to add new representations without changing the construction process.\n\n**In essence, the Builder pattern decouples how an object is constructed from what it looks like, promoting flexibility and scalability.**",

        "question": "What is the impact of creational patterns on unit testing in C#?",
        "answer": "```markdown ### Impact of Creational Patterns on Unit Testing in C#\n\nCreational design patterns in C#—such as **Singleton**, **Factory Method**, **Abstract Factory**, **Builder**, and **Prototype**—play a significant role in how objects are instantiated and managed. Their use has a direct impact on the ease and effectiveness of unit testing.\n\n#### 1. **Decoupling Object Creation**\n\nCreational patterns abstract the instantiation process, allowing dependencies to be injected or substituted. This decoupling is crucial for unit testing, as it enables the use of **mock** or **stub** objects in place of real implementations.\n\n**Example: Factory Method Pattern**\n\n```csharp\n// Product interface\npublic interface IService\n{\n    string GetData();\n}\n\n// Concrete implementation\npublic class RealService : IService\n{\n    public string GetData() => \"Real Data\";\n}\n\n// Factory interface\npublic interface IServiceFactory\n{\n    IService CreateService();\n}\n\n// Concrete factory\npublic class ServiceFactory : IServiceFactory\n{\n    public IService CreateService() => new RealService();\n}\n\n// Class under test\npublic class Consumer\n{\n    private readonly IService _service;\n    public Consumer(IServiceFactory factory)\n    {\n        _service = factory.CreateService();\n    }\n    public string FetchData() => _service.GetData();\n}\n```\n\n**Unit Test with Mock Factory:**\n\n```csharp\npublic class MockService : IService\n{\n    public string GetData() => \"Mock Data\";\n}\n\npublic class MockServiceFactory : IServiceFactory\n{\n    public IService CreateService() => new MockService();\n}\n\n// Test\n[TestMethod]\npublic void FetchData_ReturnsMockData()\n{\n    var factory = new MockServiceFactory();\n    var consumer = new Consumer(factory);\n    Assert.AreEqual(\"Mock Data\", consumer.FetchData());\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. **Testability of Singleton Pattern**\n\nThe **Singleton** pattern can hinder unit testing because it enforces a single instance, making it difficult to isolate tests and inject mocks. This can lead to **shared state** between tests and unpredictable results.\n\n**Mitigation:**  \n- Use dependency injection to provide the singleton instance.\n- Allow resetting or replacing the singleton in test environments.\n\n#### 3. **Facilitating Dependency Injection**\n\nPatterns like **Abstract Factory** and **Builder** make it easier to inject dependencies, which is a best practice for testable code. They allow you to pass in mock implementations during testing.\n\n**Example: Abstract Factory Pattern**\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IRepositoryFactory\n{\n    IRepository CreateRepository();\n}\n\n// In production\npublic class SqlRepositoryFactory : IRepositoryFactory\n{\n    public IRepository CreateRepository() => new SqlRepository();\n}\n\n// In tests\npublic class MockRepositoryFactory : IRepositoryFactory\n{\n    public IRepository CreateRepository() => new MockRepository();\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Reducing Tight Coupling**\n\nBy using creational patterns, classes depend on **abstractions** rather than concrete implementations. This reduces tight coupling and makes it easier to substitute dependencies during testing.\n\n#### 5. **Summary Table**\n\n| Pattern           | Positive Impact on Testing         | Potential Drawbacks                |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Factory Method    | Easy to inject mocks/stubs         | -                                  |\n| Abstract Factory  | Supports complex object graphs     | -                                  |\n| Builder           | Simplifies complex object creation | -                                  |\n| Prototype         | Cloning for test isolation         | -                                  |\n| Singleton         | Can hinder test isolation          | Shared state, hard to mock         |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCreational patterns, when used appropriately in C#, **greatly enhance unit testability** by promoting loose coupling and enabling dependency injection. However, patterns like Singleton require careful handling to avoid negative impacts on test isolation and maintainability. Always design with testability in mind, leveraging creational patterns to facilitate effective and reliable unit testing.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n## Implementing a Parameterized Singleton in C#\n\nA **parameterized Singleton** allows you to pass parameters to the Singleton instance during its first creation. After the instance is created, subsequent calls ignore the parameters and return the already created instance.\n\n### Challenges\n\n- The classic Singleton pattern doesn't support passing parameters to the constructor after the first instantiation.\n- You must ensure thread safety and that parameters are only used on the first creation.\n\n### Implementation Example\n\nSuppose you have a `DatabaseConnection` class that requires a connection string as a parameter.\n\n```csharp\npublic class DatabaseConnection\n{\n    public string ConnectionString { get; }\n\n    private static DatabaseConnection _instance;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    // Private constructor\n    private DatabaseConnection(string connectionString)\n    {\n        ConnectionString = connectionString;\n    }\n\n    // Parameterized Singleton accessor\n    public static DatabaseConnection GetInstance(string connectionString)\n    {\n        if (_instance == null)\n        {\n            lock (_lock)\n            {\n                if (_instance == null)\n                {\n                    _instance = new DatabaseConnection(connectionString);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return _instance;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```csharp\nvar db1 = DatabaseConnection.GetInstance(\"Server=.;Database=TestDb;Trusted_Connection=True;\");\nvar db2 = DatabaseConnection.GetInstance(\"AnotherConnectionString\");\n\n// Both db1 and db2 refer to the same instance\nConsole.WriteLine(object.ReferenceEquals(db1, db2)); // True\nConsole.WriteLine(db1.ConnectionString); // \"Server=.;Database=TestDb;Trusted_Connection=True;\"\nConsole.WriteLine(db2.ConnectionString); // \"Server=.;Database=TestDb;Trusted_Connection=True;\"\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- Only the first call to `GetInstance` uses the provided parameter.\n- Subsequent calls ignore the parameter and return the existing instance.\n- This approach is thread-safe due to the use of `lock`.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- If you need to change the parameter after creation, you must redesign your pattern (e.g., use a factory or reset method).\n- Be cautious with parameterized singletons, as misuse can lead to confusing code.\n\n---\n**Summary:**  \nA parameterized Singleton in C# can be implemented by allowing parameters in the accessor method and ensuring they are only used during the first instantiation, with thread safety considerations.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an explanation and a C# code example demonstrating the Prototype pattern using the ICloneable interface.\n\n---\n\n## Prototype Pattern in C# using ICloneable\n\nThe **Prototype** pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.\n\nIn C#, the `ICloneable` interface provides a standard way to implement object cloning.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose we have a `Person` class, and we want to create copies of `Person` objects.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Person : ICloneable\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n\n    // Implement the Clone method\n    public object Clone()\n    {\n        // Shallow copy is sufficient here as all fields are value types or immutable\n        return this.MemberwiseClone();\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Create original object\n        Person original = new Person { Name = \"Alice\", Age = 30 };\n\n        // Clone the original object\n        Person clone = (Person)original.Clone();\n\n        // Modify the clone\n        clone.Name = \"Bob\";\n        clone.Age = 25;\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Original: \" + original);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Clone: \" + clone);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nOriginal: Name: Alice, Age: 30\nClone: Name: Bob, Age: 25\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `Person` class implements `ICloneable` and provides a `Clone()` method.\n- `MemberwiseClone()` creates a shallow copy of the object.\n- In the `Main` method, we clone the original `Person` and modify the clone, demonstrating that the two objects are independent.\n\n---\n\nThis is how you can implement the Prototype pattern in C# using the `ICloneable` interface.",

        "answer": "```markdown Yes, you can combine creational design patterns in a single C# application. In fact, combining patterns is a common practice to address complex object creation scenarios. For example, you might use the **Abstract Factory** pattern together with the **Singleton** pattern to ensure that only one instance of a factory exists throughout the application.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Combining Singleton and Abstract Factory\n\nSuppose you are building a cross-platform UI library that creates UI elements for different operating systems (Windows, Mac). You want to ensure that only one factory instance exists for each platform.\n\n### Step 1: Define Product Interfaces\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IButton\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n\npublic interface ICheckbox\n{\n    void Render();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Concrete Products\n\n```csharp\npublic class WindowsButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Windows Button\");\n}\n\npublic class MacButton : IButton\n{\n    public void Render() => Console.WriteLine(\"Rendering Mac Button\");\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Abstract Factory Interface\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IUIFactory\n{\n    IButton CreateButton();\n    ICheckbox CreateCheckbox();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Concrete Factories (Singleton)\n\n```csharp\npublic class WindowsFactory : IUIFactory\n{\n    private static WindowsFactory _instance;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    private WindowsFactory() { }\n\n    public static WindowsFactory Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            lock (_lock)\n            {\n                if (_instance == null)\n                    _instance = new WindowsFactory();\n                return _instance;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => /* WindowsCheckbox implementation */;\n}\n\npublic class MacFactory : IUIFactory\n{\n    private static MacFactory _instance;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    private MacFactory() { }\n\n    public static MacFactory Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            lock (_lock)\n            {\n                if (_instance == null)\n                    _instance = new MacFactory();\n                return _instance;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new MacButton();\n    public ICheckbox CreateCheckbox() => /* MacCheckbox implementation */;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Usage\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        IUIFactory factory = WindowsFactory.Instance; // Singleton instance\n        IButton button = factory.CreateButton();\n        button.Render(); // Output: Rendering Windows Button\n\n        // Switch to Mac\n        factory = MacFactory.Instance;\n        button = factory.CreateButton();\n        button.Render(); // Output: Rendering Mac Button\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nBy combining the **Singleton** and **Abstract Factory** patterns, you ensure that:\n- Only one instance of each factory exists (Singleton).\n- The factories can create families of related objects (Abstract Factory).\n\nThis approach is useful in scenarios where you want to manage resources efficiently and maintain consistency across object creation.",

        "question": "How can you enforce Singleton property across AppDomains in C#?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Enforcing Singleton Property Across AppDomains in C#\n\nIn C#, the **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. However, **AppDomains** provide isolation boundaries within a process, and static fields (used in typical Singleton implementations) are not shared across AppDomains. This means a classic Singleton will have one instance per AppDomain, not per process.\n\n#### Why is this a Challenge?\n\n- **Static fields** are isolated per AppDomain.\n- **Singleton instance** created in one AppDomain is not accessible in another.\n\n#### Solution: Using Remoting and MarshalByRefObject\n\nTo enforce a true Singleton across AppDomains, you can:\n\n1. **Host the Singleton in a special AppDomain** (e.g., the default AppDomain).\n2. **Expose the Singleton instance via .NET Remoting** or similar inter-AppDomain communication.\n3. **Clients in other AppDomains** access the Singleton via a proxy.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\n// Singleton class must inherit from MarshalByRefObject\npublic class CrossDomainSingleton : MarshalByRefObject\n{\n    private static CrossDomainSingleton _instance;\n    private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n    private CrossDomainSingleton() { }\n\n    public static CrossDomainSingleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            lock (_lock)\n            {\n                if (_instance == null)\n                    _instance = new CrossDomainSingleton();\n                return _instance;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public string GetMessage() => \"Hello from Singleton!\";\n}\n```\n\n**Hosting the Singleton in the Default AppDomain:**\n\n```csharp\n// In your main AppDomain\nAppDomain domain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(\"OtherDomain\");\n\n// Create a proxy to the singleton in the default AppDomain\nCrossDomainSingleton singleton = CrossDomainSingleton.Instance;\n\n// Pass the proxy to the other AppDomain\ndomain.SetData(\"SingletonProxy\", singleton);\n```\n\n**Accessing the Singleton from Another AppDomain:**\n\n```csharp\n// In the other AppDomain\nvar singleton = (CrossDomainSingleton)AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(\"SingletonProxy\");\nConsole.WriteLine(singleton.GetMessage()); // Outputs: Hello from Singleton!\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n- **.NET Remoting** is deprecated in .NET Core and .NET 5+, but this approach works in .NET Framework.\n- For .NET Core and later, consider using **out-of-process singletons** (e.g., via named pipes, gRPC, or a database).\n- **MarshalByRefObject** allows the object to be accessed by reference across AppDomains.\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Approach             | .NET Framework | .NET Core/5+ | Notes                                  |\n|----------------------|:--------------:|:------------:|----------------------------------------|\n| MarshalByRefObject   |      Yes       |      No      | Use Remoting for cross-AppDomain       |\n| Out-of-process IPC   |      Yes       |     Yes      | Use named pipes, sockets, etc.         |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nTo enforce a Singleton across AppDomains in C#, host the Singleton as a `MarshalByRefObject` in a well-known AppDomain, and expose it to other AppDomains via remoting or inter-domain communication. In modern .NET, consider process-wide or distributed approaches instead.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an advanced-level answer in markdown format, including an example of using the Factory Method pattern in a plugin-based architecture in C#.\n\n---\n\n## Using the Factory Method Pattern in a Plugin-Based Architecture in C#\n\nThe **Factory Method** pattern is ideal for plugin-based architectures, where the core application needs to instantiate plugin objects without coupling to their concrete classes. This allows new plugins to be added with minimal changes to the core system.\n\n### Scenario\n\nSuppose you are building an application that supports different types of file exporters as plugins (e.g., PDF, Excel, CSV). Each exporter implements a common interface, and the application uses a factory to instantiate the appropriate exporter at runtime.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Plugin Interface\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IFileExporter\n{\n    void Export(string data, string filePath);\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement Concrete Plugins\n\n```csharp\npublic class PdfExporter : IFileExporter\n{\n    public void Export(string data, string filePath)\n    {\n        // Export logic for PDF\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Exporting data to PDF: {filePath}\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ExcelExporter : IFileExporter\n{\n    public void Export(string data, string filePath)\n    {\n        // Export logic for Excel\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Exporting data to Excel: {filePath}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the Factory Method\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class ExporterFactory\n{\n    public abstract IFileExporter CreateExporter();\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement Concrete Factories\n\n```csharp\npublic class PdfExporterFactory : ExporterFactory\n{\n    public override IFileExporter CreateExporter()\n    {\n        return new PdfExporter();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ExcelExporterFactory : ExporterFactory\n{\n    public override IFileExporter CreateExporter()\n    {\n        return new ExcelExporter();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Using the Factory in the Plugin-Based System\n\nSuppose you load the plugin type from configuration or user input:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ExportManager\n{\n    private readonly ExporterFactory _factory;\n\n    public ExportManager(ExporterFactory factory)\n    {\n        _factory = factory;\n    }\n\n    public void ExportData(string data, string filePath)\n    {\n        var exporter = _factory.CreateExporter();\n        exporter.Export(data, filePath);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Example\n\n```csharp\n// Suppose pluginType is determined at runtime (e.g., from config)\nstring pluginType = \"PDF\"; // or \"Excel\"\nExporterFactory factory = pluginType switch\n{\n    \"PDF\" => new PdfExporterFactory(),\n    \"Excel\" => new ExcelExporterFactory(),\n    _ => throw new NotSupportedException(\"Unknown exporter type\")\n};\n\nvar manager = new ExportManager(factory);\nmanager.ExportData(\"Sample Data\", \"output.pdf\");\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The **Factory Method** pattern allows the core application to instantiate plugins without knowing their concrete types.\n- New plugins can be added by implementing the interface and providing a new factory, without modifying existing code.\n- This approach enhances extensibility and maintainability in plugin-based architectures.",

        "answer": "```markdown # Using Generics with Creational Patterns in C#\n\nGenerics in C# allow you to write flexible, reusable, and type-safe code. When combined with creational design patterns, generics can help you build more robust and scalable object creation mechanisms. Below are examples of how generics can be applied to some common creational patterns in C#.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Generic Factory Pattern\n\nA generic factory can create instances of any type that has a parameterless constructor.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Factory<T> where T : new()\n{\n    public T Create()\n    {\n        return new T();\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar factory = new Factory<MyClass>();\nMyClass obj = factory.Create();\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Generic Singleton Pattern\n\nGenerics can be used to implement a singleton for any type.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Singleton<T> where T : class, new()\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<T> _instance = new Lazy<T>(() => new T());\n\n    public static T Instance => _instance.Value;\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar mySingleton = Singleton<MyClass>.Instance;\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Generic Builder Pattern\n\nA generic builder can help construct objects in a step-by-step manner.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Builder<T> where T : new()\n{\n    private T _instance = new T();\n\n    public Builder<T> SetProperty(Action<T> setter)\n    {\n        setter(_instance);\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public T Build()\n    {\n        return _instance;\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar person = new Builder<Person>()\n    .SetProperty(p => p.Name = \"Alice\")\n    .SetProperty(p => p.Age = 30)\n    .Build();\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Generic Prototype Pattern\n\nGenerics can be used to clone objects of any type that implements a specific interface.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IPrototype<T>\n{\n    T Clone();\n}\n\npublic class Person : IPrototype<Person>\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Person Clone()\n    {\n        return (Person)this.MemberwiseClone();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PrototypeFactory<T> where T : IPrototype<T>\n{\n    public T Clone(T prototype)\n    {\n        return prototype.Clone();\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nvar original = new Person { Name = \"Bob\" };\nvar factory = new PrototypeFactory<Person>();\nvar clone = factory.Clone(original);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Benefits of Using Generics with Creational Patterns\n\n- **Type Safety:** Compile-time checking of types.\n- **Reusability:** Write once, use for any type.\n- **Flexibility:** Easily extend to new types without modifying the pattern code.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGenerics greatly enhance the power and flexibility of creational design patterns in C#. By abstracting the type, you can create reusable, type-safe, and scalable object creation mechanisms that work across your application.",

In large-scale C# projects, following best practices ensures maintainability, testability, and performance.\n\n### 1. **Favor Dependency Injection**\n\n- **Why:** Promotes loose coupling and testability.\n- **How:** Use DI containers (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, Autofac) to manage object lifetimes and dependencies.\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IProduct {}\npublic class ConcreteProduct : IProduct {}\n\npublic class ProductFactory\n{\n    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;\n    public ProductFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)\n    {\n        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;\n    }\n    public IProduct CreateProduct()\n    {\n        return _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IProduct>();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Abstract Creation Logic**\n\n- **Why:** Isolates object creation, making code easier to modify and extend.\n- **How:** Use Factory Method or Abstract Factory to encapsulate instantiation.\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class Dialog\n{\n    public void RenderWindow()\n    {\n        var button = CreateButton();\n        button.Render();\n    }\n    protected abstract IButton CreateButton();\n}\n\npublic class WindowsDialog : Dialog\n{\n    protected override IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Implement Thread-Safe Singletons**\n\n- **Why:** Prevents issues in multi-threaded environments.\n- **How:** Use `Lazy<T>` or double-checked locking.\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> _instance = new(() => new Singleton());\n    public static Singleton Instance => _instance.Value;\n    private Singleton() {}\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Leverage the Builder Pattern for Complex Objects**\n\n- **Why:** Simplifies construction of objects with many optional parameters.\n- **How:** Use fluent interfaces for clarity.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Car\n{\n    public string Engine { get; set; }\n    public int Wheels { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class CarBuilder\n{\n    private Car _car = new Car();\n    public CarBuilder SetEngine(string engine) { _car.Engine = engine; return this; }\n    public CarBuilder SetWheels(int wheels) { _car.Wheels = wheels; return this; }\n    public Car Build() => _car;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Use Prototypes for Performance-Critical Scenarios**\n\n- **Why:** Cloning is faster than instantiation for expensive objects.\n- **How:** Implement `ICloneable` or custom clone methods.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Document : ICloneable\n{\n    public string Content { get; set; }\n    public object Clone() => MemberwiseClone();\n}\n```\n\n### 6. **Centralize Configuration**\n\n- **Why:** Keeps creation logic consistent and manageable.\n- **How:** Use configuration files or centralized factories.\n\n```csharp\npublic class AppConfigFactory\n{\n    public static IProduct CreateProductFromConfig(string configKey)\n    {\n        // Read config and instantiate accordingly\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. **Promote Open/Closed Principle**\n\n- **Why:** Allows extension without modifying existing code.\n- **How:** Rely on interfaces and abstract classes for factories and products.\n\n### 8. **Document and Name Patterns Clearly**\n\n- **Why:** Large teams need clarity.\n- **How:** Use clear naming conventions (e.g., `*Factory`, `*Builder`) and XML documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Pattern           | Best Practice Example                   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Singleton         | Thread-safe with `Lazy<T>`              |\n| Factory Method    | Abstract creation in base classes       |\n| Abstract Factory  | Centralize family creation              |\n| Builder           | Fluent interfaces for complex objects   |\n| Prototype         | Implement `ICloneable` or custom clone  |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Microsoft Docs: Dependency Injection in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)\n- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, you ensure your creational patterns are robust, scalable, and maintainable in large-scale C# applications.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### How Does the Use of Creational Patterns Affect Application Performance in C#?\n\nCreational design patterns in C#—such as **Singleton**, **Factory Method**, **Abstract Factory**, **Builder**, and **Prototype**—primarily focus on object creation mechanisms. Their impact on application performance depends on how and where they are applied. Below is an analysis of their effects, with C# examples:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Singleton Pattern**\n\n**Effect on Performance:**\n- **Positive:** Ensures a single instance, reducing memory usage.\n- **Negative:** Thread-safe implementations (e.g., double-checked locking) may introduce slight overhead.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> instance = new(() => new Singleton());\n    public static Singleton Instance => instance.Value;\n    private Singleton() { }\n}\n```\n*Using `Lazy<T>` ensures thread safety and lazy initialization with minimal overhead.*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Factory Method Pattern**\n\n**Effect on Performance:**\n- **Positive:** Decouples object creation, improving maintainability.\n- **Negative:** May introduce minor overhead due to additional abstraction, but negligible in most cases.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic abstract class Product { }\npublic class ConcreteProduct : Product { }\n\npublic abstract class Creator\n{\n    public abstract Product FactoryMethod();\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteCreator : Creator\n{\n    public override Product FactoryMethod() => new ConcreteProduct();\n}\n```\n*The extra method call is usually not a performance concern.*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**\n\n**Effect on Performance:**\n- **Positive:** Groups related object creations, reducing errors.\n- **Negative:** Similar to Factory Method, adds abstraction layers but minimal runtime cost.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic interface IButton { }\npublic class WindowsButton : IButton { }\npublic class MacButton : IButton { }\n\npublic interface IGUIFactory\n{\n    IButton CreateButton();\n}\n\npublic class WindowsFactory : IGUIFactory\n{\n    public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();\n}\n```\n*Abstraction helps scalability; performance impact is negligible.*\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Builder Pattern**\n\n**Effect on Performance:**\n- **Positive:** Useful for constructing complex objects step by step.\n- **Negative:** May introduce overhead if used for simple objects.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic class Product\n{\n    public string PartA { get; set; }\n    public string PartB { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class ProductBuilder\n{\n    private Product product = new();\n    public ProductBuilder SetPartA(string value) { product.PartA = value; return this; }\n    public ProductBuilder SetPartB(string value) { product.PartB = value; return this; }\n    public Product Build() => product;\n}\n```\n*Best used when object construction is complex.*\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Prototype Pattern**\n\n**Effect on Performance:**\n- **Positive:** Cloning existing objects can be faster than creating new ones, especially for expensive initialization.\n- **Negative:** Deep cloning can be costly if objects are large or contain complex references.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\npublic class Prototype : ICloneable\n{\n    public int Data { get; set; }\n    public object Clone() => this.MemberwiseClone();\n}\n```\n*Efficient for lightweight or shallow copies.*\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Pattern         | Positive Impact                      | Negative Impact                         |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Singleton       | Reduces memory, lazy init           | Thread-safety overhead                  |\n| Factory Method  | Decouples creation                  | Minor abstraction overhead              |\n| Abstract Factory| Groups related creation             | Minor abstraction overhead              |\n| Builder         | Manages complex construction        | Overkill for simple objects             |\n| Prototype       | Fast cloning                        | Deep copy can be expensive              |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCreational patterns in C# generally have **minimal impact on performance** when used appropriately. Their benefits in maintainability, scalability, and code clarity often outweigh the slight overhead introduced by abstraction. However, misuse (e.g., using Builder for simple objects or deep cloning large graphs) can negatively affect performance. Always profile and choose the pattern that best fits your scenario.",

        "question": "Describe a scenario where using the Prototype pattern is not recommended.",
        "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nThe Prototype pattern is used to create new objects by copying existing ones (prototypes), which is useful when object creation is costly or complex. However, there are scenarios where using the Prototype pattern is **not recommended**.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario: Objects with Complex or Non-Clonable Resources\n\n**Description:**  \nIf your objects manage resources that cannot or should not be duplicated (such as open file handles, database connections, or network sockets), using the Prototype pattern can lead to issues. Cloning such objects may result in multiple objects trying to manage the same resource, causing errors, resource leaks, or inconsistent states.\n\n#### Example in C#\n\n```csharp\npublic class FileHandler : ICloneable\n{\n    private FileStream fileStream;\n\n    public FileHandler(string filePath)\n    {\n        fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);\n    }\n\n    public object Clone()\n    {\n        // Problem: Cloning the FileHandler does NOT clone the file stream properly\n        // Both instances will try to use the same file handle, leading to errors\n        return this.MemberwiseClone();\n    }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        fileStream.Close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Why Not Recommended:**  \n- The cloned `FileHandler` object will reference the same `FileStream` as the original.\n- Closing the stream in one object affects the other.\n- This can cause exceptions, data corruption, or resource leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\n**Avoid the Prototype pattern when:**\n- Objects encapsulate resources that cannot be safely or meaningfully cloned.\n- Deep copying is impractical or impossible due to external dependencies.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\n- Use Factory or Builder patterns to manage resource creation.\n- Explicitly manage resource ownership and lifetimes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Scenario                        | Prototype Pattern Recommended? | Reason                                  |\n|----------------------------------|:-----------------------------:|-----------------------------------------|\n| Simple data objects              | ✔️                            | Easy to clone                           |\n| Objects with unmanaged resources | ❌                            | Cloning can cause resource conflicts    |\n| Objects with external dependencies| ❌                            | Cloning may not replicate dependencies  |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nDo **not** use the Prototype pattern when your objects manage resources that cannot be duplicated or when deep copying is not feasible. Consider alternative creational patterns in such cases.",

        "question": "How do you test classes that use creational patterns for object creation in C#?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n## Testing Classes that Use Creational Patterns in C#\n\nWhen classes use creational design patterns (such as **Factory Method**, **Abstract Factory**, **Builder**, **Prototype**, or **Singleton**) for object creation, testing can become challenging due to hidden dependencies and tightly-coupled object creation logic. Here’s how you can effectively test such classes in C#:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Expose Dependencies via Dependency Injection**\n\nInstead of instantiating dependencies directly inside your class, inject them via constructors or properties. This allows you to substitute real objects with mocks or stubs during testing.\n\n#### Example: Refactoring a Factory Method\n\n```csharp\n// Before: Direct instantiation\npublic class ReportService\n{\n    public Report GenerateReport()\n    {\n        var factory = new ReportFactory();\n        return factory.CreateReport();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```csharp\n// After: Dependency Injection\npublic class ReportService\n{\n    private readonly IReportFactory _factory;\n\n    public ReportService(IReportFactory factory)\n    {\n        _factory = factory;\n    }\n\n    public Report GenerateReport()\n    {\n        return _factory.CreateReport();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Test:**\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void GenerateReport_UsesFactory()\n{\n    var mockFactory = new Mock<IReportFactory>();\n    mockFactory.Setup(f => f.CreateReport()).Returns(new Report());\n\n    var service = new ReportService(mockFactory.Object);\n    var report = service.GenerateReport();\n\n    mockFactory.Verify(f => f.CreateReport(), Times.Once);\n    Assert.IsNotNull(report);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Use Test Doubles for Factories or Builders**\n\nWhen using **Abstract Factory** or **Builder**, provide test implementations that return controlled, predictable objects.\n\n#### Example: Abstract Factory\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IWidgetFactory\n{\n    IWidget CreateWidget();\n}\n\npublic class TestWidgetFactory : IWidgetFactory\n{\n    public IWidget CreateWidget() => new TestWidget();\n}\n```\n\n**Inject `TestWidgetFactory` in your tests to control the behavior.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Mocking Singleton Instances**\n\nFor **Singletons**, expose the instance via an interface or allow resetting the instance in test environments.\n\n#### Example: Singleton with Reset (for testing only)\n\n```csharp\npublic class Logger\n{\n    private static Logger _instance;\n    public static Logger Instance => _instance ??= new Logger();\n\n    // For testing\n    public static void Reset() => _instance = null;\n}\n```\n\n**In your test setup:**\n\n```csharp\n[SetUp]\npublic void Setup()\n{\n    Logger.Reset();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Testing Prototype Pattern**\n\nFor **Prototype**, ensure that cloning works as expected.\n\n```csharp\n[Test]\npublic void Clone_CreatesDistinctObject()\n{\n    var original = new Document { Title = \"Test\" };\n    var clone = original.Clone();\n\n    Assert.AreNotSame(original, clone);\n    Assert.AreEqual(original.Title, clone.Title);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Use Factories as Extension Points**\n\nIf your class uses a factory internally, allow it to accept a factory via constructor or property for testing.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Pattern           | Testing Approach                           |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Factory Method    | Inject factory interface, use mocks        |\n| Abstract Factory  | Inject test factory, return test objects   |\n| Builder           | Inject test builder, verify build steps    |\n| Prototype         | Test clone method, assert deep copy        |\n| Singleton         | Allow reset or interface for mocking       |\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practices**\n\n- **Favor Dependency Injection** for all dependencies, including factories and builders.\n- **Avoid hard-coding object creation** inside classes to improve testability.\n- **Use mocking frameworks** (e.g., Moq, NSubstitute) to verify interactions with factories/builders.\n- **Design for testability** by exposing extension points for object creation.\n\n---\n\nBy following these strategies, you can effectively test classes that use creational patterns in C#, ensuring your code remains maintainable and robust.\n```\n",
