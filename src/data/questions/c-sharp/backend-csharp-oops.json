It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data by using access modifiers (like `private`, `public`, `protected`).\n\n2. **Abstraction**\n   - Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. In C#, this can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces, allowing users to interact with objects at a higher level.\n\n3. **Inheritance**\n   - Inheritance allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n\n4. **Polymorphism**\n   - Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. In C#, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and interfaces, enabling the same method to behave differently in different classes.\n```\n",

This means:\n\n- Static members are shared among all instances of the class.\n- You access static members using the class name, not an object reference.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\nclass MyClass\n{\n    public static int StaticValue = 10;\n\n    public static void StaticMethod()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"This is a static method.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nConsole.WriteLine(MyClass.StaticValue); // Output: 10\nMyClass.StaticMethod(); // Output: This is a static method.\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Use the static keyword to declare static members.\n- Static members are initialized only once.\n- They can be accessed without creating an object of the class.",

Indexers enable instances of a class to be accessed using the array access operator `[]`, making the object behave like a virtual array.\n\n### Syntax\n\n```csharp\npublic <return_type> this[<parameter_type> index]\n{\n    get\n    {\n        // return the value at the specified index\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        // set the value at the specified index\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```csharp\nclass SampleCollection<T>\n{\n    private T[] arr = new T[100];\n\n    public T this[int i]\n    {\n        get { return arr[i]; }\n        set { arr[i] = value; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```csharp\nSampleCollection<string> collection = new SampleCollection<string>();\ncollection[0] = \"Hello\";\nConsole.WriteLine(collection[0]); // Output: Hello\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Indexers are defined with the `this` keyword.\n- They can be overloaded (by changing the parameter list).\n- They can have one or more parameters (multi-dimensional indexers).\n- Indexers do not have a name; they are always named `this`.\n\n**In summary:**  \nAn indexer allows a class or struct to be accessed like an array, providing a natural and intuitive way to access internal data.",

    "question": "What is operator overloading and how is it achieved in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown **Operator overloading** in C# allows you to define custom behavior for standard operators (like +, -, *, etc.) when they are applied to instances of your own classes or structs. This makes your custom types behave more like built-in types and can improve code readability and usability.\n\n### How Operator Overloading is Achieved in C#\n\n- You overload an operator by defining a special static method in your class using the `operator` keyword.\n- The method must be `public` and `static`.\n- The method name is the keyword `operator` followed by the operator symbol you want to overload.\n- Not all operators can be overloaded (e.g., `=`, `&&`, `||`, etc. cannot be overloaded).\n\n#### Example: Overloading the `+` Operator\n\n```csharp\npublic class Complex\n{\n    public int Real { get; set; }\n    public int Imaginary { get; set; }\n\n    public Complex(int real, int imaginary)\n    {\n        Real = real;\n        Imaginary = imaginary;\n    }\n\n    // Overloading the + operator\n    public static Complex operator +(Complex c1, Complex c2)\n    {\n        return new Complex(c1.Real + c2.Real, c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```csharp\nComplex c1 = new Complex(1, 2);\nComplex c2 = new Complex(3, 4);\nComplex sum = c1 + c2; // Uses the overloaded + operator\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Operator overloading improves code clarity for custom types.\n- Only certain operators can be overloaded.\n- Overloaded operators must be `public static` methods.\n- Operator overloading should be used judiciously to avoid confusing code.\n\n**In summary:** Operator overloading in C# lets you define how operators work with your own types by implementing special static methods using the `operator` keyword.",

    "answer": "```markdown **Early Binding and Late Binding in C#**\n\n### Early Binding\n\n**Definition:**  \nEarly binding refers to the process where the method or property to be invoked is determined at compile time. The compiler knows the exact type of object and its members, allowing for type checking and better performance.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Type information is known at compile time.\n- Errors are caught during compilation.\n- Faster execution due to direct method calls.\n- Achieved using normal method calls and compile-time type references.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\nclass Animal\n{\n    public void Speak()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Animal speaks\");\n    }\n}\n\nAnimal animal = new Animal();\nanimal.Speak(); // Early binding\n```\n\n---\n\n### Late Binding\n\n**Definition:**  \nLate binding refers to the process where the method or property to be invoked is determined at runtime. The compiler does not know the exact type or member at compile time, so the binding occurs during execution.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Type information is determined at runtime.\n- Errors may occur at runtime if the member does not exist.\n- Slightly slower due to runtime resolution.\n- Achieved using `dynamic` keyword or reflection.\n\n**Example using `dynamic`:**\n```csharp\ndynamic animal = new Animal();\nanimal.Speak(); // Late binding\n```\n\n**Example using Reflection:**\n```csharp\nobject animal = new Animal();\nvar method = animal.GetType().GetMethod(\"Speak\");\nmethod.Invoke(animal, null); // Late binding\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences\n\n| Early Binding                | Late Binding                  |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Resolved at compile time     | Resolved at runtime           |\n| Faster execution             | Slower execution              |\n| Compile-time type checking   | Runtime type checking         |\n| Less flexible                | More flexible                 |\n| Uses static typing           | Uses `dynamic` or reflection  |\n\n---\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- **Early Binding:** When performance and type safety are priorities.\n- **Late Binding:** When working with types unknown at compile time (e.g., COM objects, plugins, dynamic data).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nEarly binding provides better performance and compile-time safety, while late binding offers flexibility at the cost of runtime errors and performance. C# supports both approaches, allowing developers to choose based on their application requirements.",

    "answer": "```markdown\n### Covariance and Contravariance in C# OOP\n\nCovariance and contravariance are advanced concepts in C# that allow for more flexible assignment compatibility in generic interfaces and delegates, particularly when dealing with inheritance hierarchies.\n\n#### Covariance\n\nCovariance enables you to use a more derived type than originally specified. It preserves assignment compatibility for generic types. In C#, covariance is supported in generic interfaces and delegates by using the `out` keyword.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\nIEnumerable<string> strings = new List<string>();\nIEnumerable<object> objects = strings; // Covariance: IEnumerable<out T>\n```\nHere, `IEnumerable<T>` is covariant in `T` (declared as `out T`), so you can assign an `IEnumerable<string>` to an `IEnumerable<object>`.\n\n#### Contravariance\n\nContravariance enables you to use a less derived type than originally specified. It reverses assignment compatibility for generic types. In C#, contravariance is supported in generic interfaces and delegates by using the `in` keyword.\n\n**Example:**\n```csharp\nAction<object> actObject = obj => Console.WriteLine(obj);\nAction<string> actString = actObject; // Contravariance: Action<in T>\n```\nHere, `Action<T>` is contravariant in `T` (declared as `in T`), so you can assign an `Action<object>` to an `Action<string>`.\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Concept        | Keyword | Direction of Assignment        | Example Type         |\n|----------------|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Covariance     | `out`   | Derived → Base                | `IEnumerable<out T>`|\n| Contravariance | `in`    | Base → Derived                | `Action<in T>`      |\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Covariance** applies to output positions (return types).\n- **Contravariance** applies to input positions (method parameters).\n- Only interfaces and delegates can be covariant or contravariant in C#.\n\nThese features make generic collections and delegates more flexible and type-safe when working with inheritance.\n```\n",

    "question": "How does C# implement runtime polymorphism?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### How does C# implement runtime polymorphism?\n\nC# implements **runtime polymorphism** primarily through the use of **inheritance** and **virtual methods**. Runtime polymorphism, also known as **dynamic method dispatch**, allows the method to be invoked at runtime based on the actual object's type, not the reference type.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Virtual Methods**: In the base class, methods intended for polymorphic behavior are marked with the `virtual` keyword.\n2. **Override Methods**: In derived classes, these methods are overridden using the `override` keyword.\n3. **Base Class Reference**: Objects are accessed using a base class reference, but the actual method invoked is determined by the object's runtime type.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\npublic class Animal\n{\n    public virtual void Speak()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Animal speaks\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Dog : Animal\n{\n    public override void Speak()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Dog barks\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Cat : Animal\n{\n    public override void Speak()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Cat meows\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Animal a1 = new Dog();\n        Animal a2 = new Cat();\n\n        a1.Speak(); // Output: Dog barks\n        a2.Speak(); // Output: Cat meows\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### How It Works\n\n- The `Speak` method is declared as `virtual` in the base class `Animal`.\n- The derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` override the `Speak` method.\n- At runtime, when `Speak` is called on an `Animal` reference, the CLR determines the actual object type (`Dog` or `Cat`) and invokes the appropriate overridden method.\n\n#### Behind the Scenes\n\n- The .NET runtime uses a **virtual method table (vtable)** to resolve the method to call at runtime.\n- This enables **late binding**, which is the essence of runtime polymorphism.\n\n#### Summary\n\nC# achieves runtime polymorphism through:\n- Declaring methods as `virtual` in the base class.\n- Overriding those methods in derived classes using `override`.\n- Using base class references to refer to derived class objects.\n- The actual method invoked is determined at runtime based on the object's type.\n\nThis mechanism allows for flexible and extensible code, adhering to the OOP principle of **polymorphism**.\n```\n",

    "question": "What is dependency injection and how does it relate to OOP principles?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern in C# (and other object-oriented languages) that deals with how objects acquire their dependencies. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies (objects it needs to function), those dependencies are provided (injected) from the outside, typically by a framework or container.\n\n### How Dependency Injection Works\n\nIn C#, DI is commonly implemented in three ways:\n- **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.\n- **Property Injection:** Dependencies are set via public properties.\n- **Method Injection:** Dependencies are passed as parameters to methods.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\npublic interface ILogger\n{\n    void Log(string message);\n}\n\npublic class ConsoleLogger : ILogger\n{\n    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);\n}\n\npublic class OrderService\n{\n    private readonly ILogger _logger;\n\n    // Constructor Injection\n    public OrderService(ILogger logger)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public void PlaceOrder()\n    {\n        // Business logic...\n        _logger.Log(\"Order placed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Relation to OOP Principles\n\nDependency Injection supports several core OOP principles:\n\n- **Abstraction:** By depending on interfaces (e.g., `ILogger`), classes are abstracted from concrete implementations.\n- **Encapsulation:** Dependencies are managed externally, keeping classes focused on their primary responsibilities.\n- **Loose Coupling:** Classes are less tightly bound to specific implementations, making code more flexible and easier to maintain or test.\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Classes do not manage the creation of their dependencies, adhering to SRP by focusing on their main logic.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Testability:** Easier to substitute dependencies with mocks or stubs during unit testing.\n- **Maintainability:** Changes to dependencies require less modification to dependent classes.\n- **Reusability:** Classes can be reused with different implementations of their dependencies.\n\n### Summary\n\nDependency Injection is a key pattern in OOP that promotes loose coupling, modularity, and testability by externalizing the creation and management of dependencies. It aligns closely with SOLID principles and is widely used in modern C# applications, especially with frameworks like ASP.NET Core.\n```",

    "question": "What is reflection in C# and how can it be used with OOP concepts?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### What is Reflection in C# and How Can It Be Used with OOP Concepts?\n\n**Reflection** in C# is a powerful feature provided by the .NET Framework that allows programs to inspect and manipulate their own structure and metadata at runtime. It is part of the `System.Reflection` namespace.\n\n#### Key Capabilities of Reflection\n\n- **Inspecting Types:** You can examine assemblies, modules, types (classes, interfaces, structs, enums, delegates), and their members (methods, properties, fields, events).\n- **Dynamic Instantiation:** Create instances of types dynamically at runtime.\n- **Invoking Members:** Invoke methods, access properties, and fields dynamically.\n- **Accessing Attributes:** Retrieve custom attributes applied to types and members.\n\n#### How Reflection Relates to OOP Concepts\n\nReflection enhances and interacts with core OOP concepts in several ways:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**\n   - Reflection can bypass encapsulation by allowing access to private and protected members, though this should be used judiciously (e.g., for testing or serialization).\n\n2. **Polymorphism**\n   - Reflection can be used to discover and invoke overridden or implemented methods at runtime, supporting dynamic method invocation.\n\n3. **Inheritance**\n   - Reflection allows you to traverse the inheritance hierarchy, inspect base types, and analyze inherited members.\n\n4. **Abstraction**\n   - Reflection can be used to work with abstract types (interfaces or abstract classes) by discovering their concrete implementations at runtime.\n\n#### Example: Using Reflection with OOP\n\nSuppose you have a base class and a derived class:\n\n```csharp\npublic abstract class Animal\n{\n    public abstract void Speak();\n}\n\npublic class Dog : Animal\n{\n    public override void Speak()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Woof!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use reflection to:\n\n- Discover all types that inherit from `Animal`.\n- Dynamically create an instance of `Dog`.\n- Invoke the `Speak` method without knowing the concrete type at compile time.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Reflection;\n\nType animalType = typeof(Animal);\nAssembly assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();\n\nforeach (Type type in assembly.GetTypes())\n{\n    if (animalType.IsAssignableFrom(type) && !type.IsAbstract)\n    {\n        // Create an instance dynamically\n        Animal animal = (Animal)Activator.CreateInstance(type);\n        // Invoke method dynamically\n        MethodInfo speakMethod = type.GetMethod(\"Speak\");\n        speakMethod.Invoke(animal, null);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Common Use Cases\n\n- **Dependency Injection Containers**\n- **ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers)**\n- **Serialization/Deserialization**\n- **Unit Testing Frameworks**\n- **Plugin Architectures**\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| OOP Concept     | Reflection Usage Example                                   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Encapsulation   | Accessing private fields for testing                      |\n| Inheritance     | Discovering derived types at runtime                      |\n| Polymorphism    | Invoking overridden methods dynamically                   |\n| Abstraction     | Instantiating concrete types from abstract base types     |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nReflection in C# provides runtime type inspection and manipulation capabilities, which can be leveraged to implement flexible, extensible, and dynamic OOP-based solutions.\n```\n",

    "question": "How can you implement custom events and delegates in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing Custom Events and Delegates in C#\n\nIn C#, **delegates** are type-safe function pointers, and **events** are a way to provide notifications. Custom events and delegates are fundamental to implementing the Observer pattern and building loosely coupled systems.\n\n#### 1. Define a Delegate\n\nA delegate defines the signature for the event handler methods.\n\n```csharp\npublic delegate void MyCustomEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);\n```\n\n#### 2. Declare an Event\n\nUse the `event` keyword with the delegate type to declare an event in your class.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Publisher\n{\n    public event MyCustomEventHandler MyCustomEvent;\n\n    public void RaiseEvent()\n    {\n        // Invoke the event if there are any subscribers\n        MyCustomEvent?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Subscribe to the Event\n\nOther classes can subscribe to the event using `+=` and unsubscribe using `-=`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Subscriber\n{\n    public void OnMyCustomEvent(object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Event received!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();\n        Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();\n\n        // Subscribe to the event\n        publisher.MyCustomEvent += subscriber.OnMyCustomEvent;\n\n        // Raise the event\n        publisher.RaiseEvent();\n\n        // Unsubscribe if needed\n        publisher.MyCustomEvent -= subscriber.OnMyCustomEvent;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Custom EventArgs\n\nFor passing custom data, derive from `EventArgs`:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyEventArgs : EventArgs\n{\n    public string Message { get; set; }\n}\npublic delegate void MyCustomEventHandler(object sender, MyEventArgs e);\n```\n\n#### 6. Encapsulating Event Access\n\nYou can provide custom add/remove logic for events:\n\n```csharp\nprivate MyCustomEventHandler _myCustomEvent;\npublic event MyCustomEventHandler MyCustomEvent\n{\n    add { _myCustomEvent += value; }\n    remove { _myCustomEvent -= value; }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo implement custom events and delegates in C#, define a delegate, declare an event using that delegate, raise the event in your class, and allow other classes to subscribe/unsubscribe to the event. This enables flexible and decoupled event-driven programming.\n```\n",

    "question": "What is the SOLID principle in OOP and how does it apply to C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n## SOLID Principles in OOP and Their Application in C#\n\nThe **SOLID** principles are a set of five design guidelines intended to make object-oriented software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are especially relevant in C#, which is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language. Here’s a breakdown of each principle and its application in C#:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n**Definition:**  \nA class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.\n\n**C# Example:**\n```csharp\n// Bad: Handles both user data and file operations\nclass UserManager {\n    public void AddUser(User user) { /* ... */ }\n    public void SaveToFile(User user) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\n// Good: Separate responsibilities\nclass UserManager {\n    public void AddUser(User user) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\nclass UserFileSaver {\n    public void SaveToFile(User user) { /* ... */ }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\n**Definition:**  \nSoftware entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n\n**C# Example:**\n```csharp\n// Using abstract classes or interfaces for extension\npublic abstract class Shape {\n    public abstract double Area();\n}\n\npublic class Circle : Shape {\n    public double Radius { get; set; }\n    public override double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : Shape {\n    public double Width { get; set; }\n    public double Height { get; set; }\n    public override double Area() => Width * Height;\n}\n```\n*New shapes can be added without modifying existing code.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n**Definition:**  \nObjects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.\n\n**C# Example:**\n```csharp\npublic class Bird {\n    public virtual void Fly() { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class Sparrow : Bird { }\n\npublic class Ostrich : Bird {\n    public override void Fly() {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Ostrich can't fly!\");\n    }\n}\n// Violates LSP: Ostrich is a Bird, but can't fly. Better to refactor hierarchy.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n**Definition:**  \nClients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n\n**C# Example:**\n```csharp\n// Bad: One big interface\npublic interface IWorker {\n    void Work();\n    void Eat();\n}\n\n// Good: Split into smaller interfaces\npublic interface IWorkable {\n    void Work();\n}\n\npublic interface IFeedable {\n    void Eat();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n**Definition:**  \nHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n\n**C# Example:**\n```csharp\n// Bad: Direct dependency\npublic class EmailSender {\n    public void Send(string message) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class Notification {\n    private EmailSender _emailSender = new EmailSender();\n    public void Notify(string message) {\n        _emailSender.Send(message);\n    }\n}\n\n// Good: Depend on abstraction\npublic interface IMessageSender {\n    void Send(string message);\n}\n\npublic class EmailSender : IMessageSender {\n    public void Send(string message) { /* ... */ }\n}\n\npublic class Notification {\n    private readonly IMessageSender _messageSender;\n    public Notification(IMessageSender messageSender) {\n        _messageSender = messageSender;\n    }\n    public void Notify(string message) {\n        _messageSender.Send(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nApplying the **SOLID** principles in C# leads to code that is easier to maintain, extend, and test. These principles encourage the use of interfaces, abstractions, and proper class design, which are all well-supported in C# through its rich object-oriented features.\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown To prevent a class from being inherited in C#, you use the `sealed` keyword. A sealed class cannot be used as a base class, meaning no other class can derive from it.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\nsealed class MyClass\n{\n    // Class members go here\n}\n\n// The following will cause a compile-time error:\nclass DerivedClass : MyClass\n{\n    // Error: 'MyClass' is sealed and cannot be inherited\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Use `sealed` before the class declaration.\n- Sealed classes are often used to prevent further derivation for security, design, or optimization reasons.\n- You can also seal individual methods in a derived class to prevent them from being overridden further.",

    "question": "How does C# handle object finalization and garbage collection?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### How does C# handle object finalization and garbage collection?\n\nC# manages memory automatically through a process called **garbage collection (GC)**, which is part of the .NET runtime. Here's how it works in the context of object finalization and memory management:\n\n#### Garbage Collection\n\n- **Automatic Memory Management:** When objects are created in C#, they are allocated on the managed heap. The garbage collector periodically checks for objects that are no longer accessible by any references in the application.\n- **Mark and Sweep:** The GC marks all reachable objects and then sweeps the heap to reclaim memory from unreachable objects.\n- **Generational Collection:** The heap is divided into generations (Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2) to optimize collection. New objects are allocated in Gen 0, and surviving objects are promoted to higher generations.\n\n#### Object Finalization\n\n- **Finalizer (~ClassName):** If a class needs to perform cleanup before the object is reclaimed (e.g., releasing unmanaged resources), it can define a finalizer using the `~ClassName()` syntax.\n- **Non-Deterministic:** The finalizer is called by the GC, not by user code, and the exact time when it runs is non-deterministic.\n- **Suppression and Re-Registration:** You can suppress finalization using `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` if cleanup is done manually (e.g., via `IDisposable`). You can also re-register an object for finalization using `GC.ReRegisterForFinalize(this)`.\n\n#### IDisposable and the Dispose Pattern\n\n- **Deterministic Cleanup:** To allow deterministic release of resources, C# uses the `IDisposable` interface and the `Dispose` method. This is especially important for unmanaged resources.\n- **Dispose Pattern:** The recommended pattern is to implement both `Dispose` and a finalizer, ensuring resources are released properly whether or not `Dispose` is called.\n\n#### Example\n\n```csharp\nclass MyResource : IDisposable\n{\n    private bool disposed = false;\n\n    // Finalizer\n    ~MyResource()\n    {\n        Dispose(false);\n    }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        Dispose(true);\n        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevent finalizer from running\n    }\n\n    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)\n    {\n        if (!disposed)\n        {\n            if (disposing)\n            {\n                // Free managed resources\n            }\n            // Free unmanaged resources\n            disposed = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Feature         | Purpose                                  | Triggered By         | Determinism      |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Garbage Collector | Reclaims memory for unreachable objects | .NET runtime         | Non-deterministic|\n| Finalizer       | Cleanup before object is collected        | Garbage Collector    | Non-deterministic|\n| IDisposable     | Deterministic resource cleanup            | User code (`Dispose`)| Deterministic    |\n\n**In summary:**  \nC# uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory, and provides finalizers for non-deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources. For deterministic cleanup, the `IDisposable` interface and the Dispose pattern are used.\n```\n",

    "question": "What are extension methods and how do they relate to OOP?",
    "answer": "```markdown **Extension Methods in C# and Their Relation to OOP**\n\nExtension methods are a feature in C# that allow developers to \"add\" new methods to existing types without modifying the original type, creating a derived type, or recompiling the code. They are defined as static methods in static classes, but are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.\n\n### Syntax Example\n\n```csharp\npublic static class StringExtensions\n{\n    public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(this string str)\n    {\n        return string.IsNullOrEmpty(str);\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage:\nstring s = null;\nbool result = s.IsNullOrEmpty(); // Calls the extension method\n```\n\n### How Extension Methods Relate to OOP\n\n- **Open/Closed Principle**: Extension methods support the OOP principle of being open for extension but closed for modification. You can extend the functionality of existing classes (even those you don't own, like .NET framework types) without altering their source code.\n- **Encapsulation**: While extension methods provide additional functionality, they do not break encapsulation because they cannot access private members of the extended type—only public and protected members.\n- **Polymorphism**: Extension methods do not support polymorphism. If an instance method with the same signature exists, the instance method is called instead of the extension method.\n- **Separation of Concerns**: By grouping extension methods in static classes, you can keep related functionality together, promoting better organization and maintainability.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Extension methods are static but can be called as if they were instance methods.\n- They allow you to extend sealed or third-party classes.\n- They do not modify the original type or support overriding.\n- They are resolved at compile time, not runtime.\n\n**In summary:** Extension methods provide a way to extend the behavior of existing types in a manner consistent with OOP principles, particularly the open/closed principle, but they do not offer true polymorphic behavior.",

    "question": "How do you implement the Singleton pattern in C#?",
    "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing the Singleton Pattern in C#\n\nThe Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In C#, the most common and thread-safe way to implement a Singleton is using a `static` property and a `private` constructor.\n\n#### Example: Thread-Safe Singleton Implementation\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    // Private static readonly instance\n    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();\n\n    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation\n    private Singleton()\n    {\n        // Initialization code here\n    }\n\n    // Public static property to provide global access point\n    public static Singleton Instance\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _instance;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Example method\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Singleton instance method called.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Private Constructor:** Prevents external instantiation.\n- **Static Readonly Instance:** Ensures only one instance is created, and it's thread-safe due to static initialization.\n- **Global Access Point:** The `Instance` property provides access to the singleton object.\n- **Sealed Class:** Prevents inheritance, which could lead to multiple instances.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```csharp\nSingleton singleton = Singleton.Instance;\nsingleton.DoSomething();\n```\n\n#### Alternative: Lazy Initialization (with Lazy<T>)\n\nIf you want lazy initialization (instance created only when needed), use `Lazy<T>`:\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class Singleton\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> _lazyInstance = new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());\n\n    private Singleton() { }\n\n    public static Singleton Instance => _lazyInstance.Value;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is also thread-safe and delays creation until first use.\n\n---\n**Summary:**  \nImplement the Singleton pattern in C# by using a private constructor, a static readonly instance (or `Lazy<T>` for lazy initialization), and a public static property for access.\n```\n",

    "answer": "```markdown\nC# supports generics to enable type-safe data structures and methods without committing to actual data types at compile time. This is a powerful feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that promotes code reusability, type safety, and performance.\n\n## Generic Classes\n\nA generic class allows you to define a class with placeholders for the data types it stores or uses. The actual type is specified when an instance of the class is created.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\npublic class GenericList<T>\n{\n    private T[] items;\n    private int count;\n\n    public GenericList(int size)\n    {\n        items = new T[size];\n        count = 0;\n    }\n\n    public void Add(T item)\n    {\n        items[count++] = item;\n    }\n\n    public T Get(int index)\n    {\n        return items[index];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `T` is a type parameter, replaced with a real type (e.g., `int`, `string`) when you create an object:\n    ```csharp\n    var intList = new GenericList<int>(10);\n    var stringList = new GenericList<string>(10);\n    ```\n\n## Generic Methods\n\nGeneric methods define type parameters at the method level, allowing the method to operate on different data types without duplicating code.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\npublic class Utilities\n{\n    public static void Swap<T>(ref T a, ref T b)\n    {\n        T temp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = temp;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `Swap` can be used with any data type:\n    ```csharp\n    int x = 5, y = 10;\n    Utilities.Swap<int>(ref x, ref y);\n\n    string s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"world\";\n    Utilities.Swap(ref s1, ref s2); // Type inference\n    ```\n\n## Benefits in OOP\n\n- **Type Safety:** Errors are caught at compile time.\n- **Code Reusability:** Write once, use for any data type.\n- **Performance:** No boxing/unboxing for value types.\n\n## Constraints\n\nC# allows you to specify constraints on generic types to enforce certain behaviors:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Repository<T> where T : class, new()\n{\n    public T CreateInstance()\n    {\n        return new T();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- `where T : class, new()` restricts `T` to reference types with a parameterless constructor.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nC# generics enable the creation of flexible, reusable, and type-safe classes and methods, which are fundamental to robust OOP design.\n```\n",

How to Implement a Custom Attribute\n\nTo create a custom attribute:\n\n- Inherit from `System.Attribute`.\n- Optionally, define constructors and properties to store attribute data.\n- Use the `[AttributeUsage]` attribute to specify where your attribute can be applied.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```csharp\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method, Inherited = false)]\npublic class AuthorAttribute : Attribute\n{\n    public string Name { get; }\n    public double Version { get; set; }\n\n    public AuthorAttribute(string name)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Applying Custom Attributes\n\nYou can apply your custom attribute to classes, methods, etc.:\n\n```csharp\n[Author(\"Alice\", Version = 1.1)]\npublic class SampleClass\n{\n    [Author(\"Bob\", Version = 1.2)]\n    public void SampleMethod() { }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Retrieving Attribute Data via Reflection\n\nAttributes are accessed at runtime using reflection:\n\n```csharp\nType type = typeof(SampleClass);\nobject[] attrs = type.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AuthorAttribute), false);\n\nforeach (AuthorAttribute attr in attrs)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Author: {attr.Name}, Version: {attr.Version}\");\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Use in OOP\n\nCustom attributes enhance OOP in C# by:\n\n- **Adding Metadata:** Attach descriptive or behavioral information to classes, methods, properties, etc.\n- **Supporting Frameworks/Tools:** Many frameworks (e.g., ASP.NET, Entity Framework) use attributes for configuration and behavior control.\n- **Aspect-Oriented Programming:** Implement cross-cutting concerns (like logging, validation) declaratively.\n- **Custom Processing:** Enable custom logic based on attribute presence (e.g., custom serialization, validation).\n\n**Example: Marking Methods for Logging**\n\n```csharp\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]\npublic class LogAttribute : Attribute { }\n\npublic class MyService\n{\n    [Log]\n    public void ImportantOperation() { }\n}\n```\n\nA logging framework could use reflection to find methods marked with `[Log]` and inject logging behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nCustom attributes in C# are a powerful OOP feature for attaching metadata to code elements. They are implemented by inheriting from `System.Attribute`, applied declaratively, and accessed via reflection to influence program behavior or provide additional information.\n```\n",
