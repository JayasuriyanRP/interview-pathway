        "answer": "```markdown **Container and Presentational Component Pattern in React**\n\nThe Container and Presentational Component pattern is a way to separate concerns in your React applications by splitting components into two distinct types:\n\n### 1. Presentational Components\n- **Purpose:** Focus on how things look (UI).\n- **Responsibilities:** Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props.\n- **Characteristics:**\n  - Rarely have their own state (except for UI state like `isOpen`).\n  - Don’t know where the data comes from or how to change it.\n  - Usually functional components.\n\n```jsx\nfunction UserProfile({ name, onLogout }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{name}</h1>\n      <button onClick={onLogout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Container Components\n- **Purpose:** Focus on how things work (logic, data fetching, state).\n- **Responsibilities:** Provide data and behavior to presentational components.\n- **Characteristics:**\n  - May contain state and lifecycle methods.\n  - Handle data fetching, state management, and pass data down as props.\n  - Usually class components or use hooks.\n\n```jsx\nfunction UserProfileContainer() {\n  const [user, setUser] = React.useState({ name: \"Alice\" });\n\n  const handleLogout = () => {\n    // logout logic here\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <UserProfile name={user.name} onLogout={handleLogout} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Presentational Components:** UI only, stateless, receive props.\n- **Container Components:** Logic, state, data fetching, pass props to presentational components.\n\nThis pattern helps keep your code organized, reusable, and easier to test.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nA **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** is an advanced pattern in React for reusing component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced or additional functionality.\n\n### How it Works\n\n- **Function Signature:**  \n  ```js\n  const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);\n  ```\n- The HOC receives a component (`WrappedComponent`) as an argument.\n- It returns a new component (`EnhancedComponent`) that renders the original component with extra props, state, or behavior.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\n// A simple HOC that adds a \"loading\" prop\nfunction withLoading(Component) {\n  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {\n    const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);\n\n    React.useEffect(() => {\n      // Simulate loading\n      setTimeout(() => setLoading(false), 1000);\n    }, []);\n\n    return <Component loading={loading} {...props} />;\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction MyComponent({ loading }) {\n  return loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <div>Data Loaded!</div>;\n}\n\nconst MyComponentWithLoading = withLoading(MyComponent);\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- HOCs do **not** modify the original component; they create a new one.\n- They are commonly used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, data fetching, or theming.\n- HOCs are a pattern, not a feature built into React.\n\n### Summary\n\nA Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced capabilities, allowing you to reuse logic across multiple components.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Controlled Components**  \nIn React, a controlled component is a form element (like <input>, <textarea>, or <select>) whose value is controlled by React state. The component’s value is set via props and updated through event handlers. This means React is the \"single source of truth\" for the input data.\n\n**Example:**\n```jsx\nfunction ControlledInput() {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n  return (\n    <input\n      type=\"text\"\n      value={value}\n      onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Uncontrolled Components**  \nAn uncontrolled component manages its own state internally. Instead of using React state, you access the value using a ref (reference) to the DOM node. React does not control the value directly.\n\n**Example:**\n```jsx\nfunction UncontrolledInput() {\n  const inputRef = React.useRef(null);\n  const handleSubmit = () => {\n    alert(inputRef.current.value);\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input type=\"text\" ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n| Controlled Component                | Uncontrolled Component             |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Value controlled by React state     | Value controlled by the DOM        |\n| Requires onChange handler           | Uses refs to access values         |\n| Easier to validate and manipulate   | Simpler for quick, one-off forms   |\n| More predictable and testable       | Less code for simple use cases     |\n\n**Summary:**  \nUse controlled components when you need React to manage and validate form data. Use uncontrolled components for simple forms or when you need direct access to the DOM.",

        "answer": "```markdown The **Provider pattern** in React is a design pattern that helps manage and share state across different components in an application without having to pass props manually at every level (a problem known as \"prop drilling\").\n\n### How It Works\n\n- The Provider pattern uses React’s **Context API**.\n- A **Provider** component wraps part (or all) of your component tree and supplies a value (such as state or functions) to all its descendants.\n- Any child component can access this shared value using the **useContext** hook or the **Context.Consumer** component.\n\n### Benefits for State Management\n\n- **Centralized State:** Keeps shared state in one place, making it easier to manage and update.\n- **Avoids Prop Drilling:** No need to pass props through multiple levels of components.\n- **Improved Readability:** Components that need the state can access it directly, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';\n\n// 1. Create a Context\nconst ThemeContext = createContext();\n\n// 2. Create a Provider component\nfunction ThemeProvider({ children }) {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>\n      {children}\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// 3.

        "question": "How do you implement code splitting in React?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n**Implementing Code Splitting in React**\n\nCode splitting is a technique that helps improve the performance of React applications by splitting the code into smaller bundles, which are loaded on demand. This reduces the initial load time and improves user experience.\n\n### How to Implement Code Splitting\n\n#### 1. Using React.lazy and Suspense\n\nReact provides the `React.lazy()` function for dynamic import of components, and the `Suspense` component to handle the loading state.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\n\n// Lazy load the component\nconst MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My App</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <MyComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n- `React.lazy()` takes a function that returns a dynamic `import()`.\n- `Suspense` wraps the lazy component and displays a fallback (e.g., a loading spinner) while the component is loading.\n\n#### 2. Code Splitting with React Router\n\nWhen using React Router, you can lazy load route components:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst Home = React.lazy(() => import('./Home'));\nconst About = React.lazy(() => import('./About'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading page...</div>}>\n        <Routes>\n          <Route path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" element={<About />} />\n        </Routes>\n      </Suspense>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Imports for Utility Functions\n\nYou can also use dynamic imports for non-component code, such as utility functions, to further optimize bundle size:\n\n```jsx\nasync function handleClick() {\n  const { calculate } = await import('./utils');\n  calculate();\n}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Faster initial load:** Only the necessary code is loaded at startup.\n- **On-demand loading:** Additional code is loaded as needed.\n- **Improved user experience:** Reduces perceived load times.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Use `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for component-level code splitting.\n- Combine with React Router for route-based code splitting.\n- Use dynamic `import()` for utilities and other non-component code.\n\n**References:**\n- [React Docs: Code-Splitting](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy)\n- [React Docs: Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)\n```\n",

Instead of the component maintaining its own state internally, the parent component controls the value and responds to changes. This pattern is commonly used in form elements like `<input>`, `<select>`, and custom components.\n\n### How It Works\n\nA controlled component receives its current value as a prop (`value`) and notifies changes via a callback prop (`onChange`). The parent component holds the state and updates it in response to these callbacks.\n\n```jsx\n// Parent component\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <ControlledInput\n      value={value}\n      onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n// Controlled component\nfunction ControlledInput({ value, onChange }) {\n  return <input value={value} onChange={onChange} />;\n}\n```\n\n### When Is It Useful?\n\n- **Centralized State Management:** When you want the parent to have full control over the component’s state (e.g., for validation, conditional rendering, or synchronizing multiple components).\n- **Reusable Components:** When building reusable components that need to work in both controlled and uncontrolled modes.\n- **Predictable Behavior:** Ensures the component’s value is always in sync with the parent’s state, making debugging and testing easier.\n- **Form Libraries:** Widely used in form handling libraries (like Formik or React Hook Form) to manage form state externally.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Controlled Props pattern is useful when you need external control over a component’s state, enabling predictable, reusable, and easily testable components.",

        "answer": "```markdown The **State Reducer pattern** in React is a design pattern that allows you to give consumers of your component more control over how its state changes. Instead of managing all state transitions internally, your component delegates the decision-making for state updates to a reducer function provided by the consumer.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Internal State Management**  \n   Your component manages its own state as usual, but whenever it needs to update the state, it calls a reducer function instead of directly setting the new state.\n\n2. **Reducer Function**  \n   The reducer function receives the current state and the proposed changes (often called \"action\" or \"changes\"), and returns the new state. This function can be provided by the consumer of your component, allowing them to intercept or modify state changes.\n\n3. **Default Reducer**  \n   If the consumer does not provide a reducer, your component uses a default reducer that simply applies the proposed changes.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\nfunction useToggle({ initialOn = false, stateReducer } = {}) {\n  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(initialOn);\n\n  function internalSetOn(newState) {\n    setOn(prevOn => {\n      const changes = typeof newState === 'function' ? newState(prevOn) : newState;\n      // Use the stateReducer to determine the next state\n      return stateReducer ? stateReducer(prevOn, changes) : changes;\n    });\n  }\n\n  function toggle() {\n    internalSetOn(prevOn => !prevOn);\n  }\n\n  return { on, toggle };\n}\n\n// Usage with a custom reducer\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const stateReducer = (state, changes) => {\n    // Prevent toggling off\n    if (!changes) return state;\n    return changes;\n  };\n\n  const { on, toggle } = useToggle({ stateReducer });\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={toggle}>\n      {on ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Flexibility:** Consumers can control or veto state changes.\n- **Reusability:** The component logic is more reusable and adaptable to different use cases.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** The component focuses on state management, while consumers handle business logic.\n\n### When to Use\n\nUse the State Reducer pattern when you want to provide a highly flexible component that can be adapted to a variety of complex use cases, especially when consumers may need to control or restrict state transitions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe State Reducer pattern in React lets consumers influence or override how a component updates its state by providing a reducer function, making components more flexible and customizable.",

        "answer": "```markdown To avoid prop drilling in deeply nested React components, you can use the **Context API** or **state management libraries**. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Using React Context API\n\nThe Context API allows you to share values (like props or state) across the component tree without passing props manually at every level.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\n// 1. Create a Context\nconst UserContext = createContext();\n\n// 2. Provide the context value at a high level\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={{ name: 'Alice' }}>\n      <Parent />\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\nfunction Child() {\n  // 3. Consume the context value in any deeply nested component\n  const user = useContext(UserContext);\n  return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Using State Management Libraries\n\nLibraries like **Redux**, **MobX**, or **Zustand** allow you to manage and access global state from any component, avoiding prop drilling.\n\n**Example with Redux:**\n\n```jsx\n// Access state using useSelector in any component\nimport { useSelector } from 'react-redux';\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  const user = useSelector(state => state.user);\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Pattern                | Description                                      |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Context API            | Share data globally without manual prop passing  |\n| State Management Libs  | Centralize state for access across components    |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nUse the Context API or a state management library to avoid prop drilling and make your React app more maintainable and scalable.",

        "answer": "```markdown **The Module Pattern in React**\n\nThe **Module Pattern** is a design pattern used to encapsulate and organize code into self-contained, reusable units. In React, this often means structuring related logic, components, or utilities into separate files or modules. Each module exposes only what is necessary (using `export`) and keeps internal details private, promoting separation of concerns.\n\n### How It Helps with Code Organization\n\n- **Encapsulation:** Keeps related logic together and hides implementation details, exposing only a public API.\n- **Reusability:** Modules can be imported and reused across different parts of the application.\n- **Maintainability:** Smaller, focused modules are easier to read, test, and maintain.\n- **Namespace Management:** Prevents naming collisions by keeping variables and functions scoped within modules.\n\n### Example\n\n```js\n// userService.js (a module)\nconst API_URL = 'https://api.example.com/users';\n\nexport function fetchUsers() {\n  return fetch(API_URL).then(res => res.json());\n}\n\nexport function createUser(user) {\n  return fetch(API_URL, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: JSON.stringify(user),\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }\n  }).then(res => res.json());\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// UserList.jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { fetchUsers } from './userService';\n\nfunction UserList() {\n  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchUsers().then(setUsers);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Module Pattern in React helps you break your application into manageable, logical pieces, making your codebase more organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.",

        "question": "How do you implement the Singleton pattern in a React application?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing the Singleton Pattern in a React Application\n\nThe **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In React applications, this is commonly used for shared services, such as API clients, event buses, or state managers that need to be accessed across multiple components.\n\n#### Example: Singleton Service for API Calls\n\nYou can implement a singleton in JavaScript by exporting a single instance of a class or object:\n\n```js\n// apiService.js\nclass ApiService {\n  constructor() {\n    if (ApiService.instance) {\n      return ApiService.instance;\n    }\n    this.baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';\n    ApiService.instance = this;\n  }\n\n  async getData(endpoint) {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/${endpoint}`);\n    return response.json();\n  }\n}\n\nconst apiService = new ApiService();\nexport default apiService;\n```\n\nNow, in your React components, you can import and use the same instance:\n\n```js\n// MyComponent.jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport apiService from './apiService';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    apiService.getData('users').then(setData);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- The singleton instance is created once and reused everywhere it's imported.\n- This pattern is useful for services that should maintain shared state or configuration.\n- In React, you can also use Context to provide singleton-like services to the component tree.\n\n#### Alternative: Singleton with Context\n\nFor React-specific singletons, such as global state or configuration, you can use the Context API:\n\n```js\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst SingletonContext = createContext();\n\nexport function SingletonProvider({ children }) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState('shared value');\n  return (\n    <SingletonContext.Provider value={{ value, setValue }}>\n      {children}\n    </SingletonContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function useSingleton() {\n  return useContext(SingletonContext);\n}\n```\n\nNow, wrap your app with `SingletonProvider` and use `useSingleton()` in any component to access the shared instance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nImplement the Singleton pattern in React by exporting a single instance of a class or using Context for shared state/services. This ensures only one instance is used throughout your application.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ## Observer Pattern in React\n\nThe **Observer pattern** is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event handling systems.\n\n### How the Observer Pattern Works\n\n- **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.\n- **Observers**: Subscribe to the subject and update themselves when notified.\n\n### Using the Observer Pattern in React\n\nWhile React's built-in state and props system already provides a way to propagate changes, the Observer pattern can be useful in more complex scenarios, such as global state management or when integrating with external data sources.\n\n#### Example: Implementing a Simple Observer Pattern\n\n```jsx\n// Subject (Store)\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { count: 0 };\n    this.observers = [];\n  }\n\n  subscribe(observer) {\n    this.observers.push(observer);\n  }\n\n  unsubscribe(observer) {\n    this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);\n  }\n\n  setState(newState) {\n    this.state = { ...this.state, ...newState };\n    this.notify();\n  }\n\n  notify() {\n    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer(this.state));\n  }\n}\n\nconst store = new Store();\n\n// Observer (React Component)\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(store.state.count);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Subscribe to store updates\n    const observer = (state) => setCount(state.count);\n    store.subscribe(observer);\n\n    // Cleanup on unmount\n    return () => store.unsubscribe(observer);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => store.setState({ count: count + 1 })}>\n        Increment\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Real-World Usage\n\n- **State Management Libraries**: Libraries like [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) use the Observer pattern to automatically update React components when the underlying state changes.\n- **Event Emitters**: Custom event systems or pub/sub mechanisms often use this pattern.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- Decouples components from the data source.\n- Makes it easy to have multiple components react to the same data changes.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Observer pattern enables efficient communication between a subject and multiple observers. In React, it can be implemented manually or leveraged via libraries to manage state and trigger component updates in response to data changes.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nSome common anti-patterns to avoid in React development include:\n\n1. **Mutating State Directly**\n   - Directly modifying state (e.g., `this.state.value = newValue`) instead of using `setState` can lead to unpredictable UI updates and bugs.\n\n2. **Excessive Component Re-Renders**\n   - Not using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback` when needed can cause unnecessary re-renders, hurting performance.\n\n3. **Large, Monolithic Components**\n   - Packing too much logic/UI into a single component makes code hard to read, test, and maintain. Prefer breaking components into smaller, reusable pieces.\n\n4. **Using Index as Key in Lists**\n   - Using array indices as keys in lists (e.g., `<li key={index}>`) can cause rendering bugs, especially when items are reordered or removed. Use unique, stable IDs instead.\n\n5. **Storing Derived Data in State**\n   - Storing values in state that can be computed from props or other state leads to inconsistencies. Compute such values on the fly or use memoization.\n\n6. **Side Effects in Render**\n   - Performing side effects (e.g., API calls, subscriptions) directly inside the render method or function body instead of using `useEffect` or lifecycle methods can cause unexpected behavior.\n\n7. **Prop Drilling**\n   - Passing props through many layers of components can make code hard to manage. Consider using Context API or state management libraries for deeply shared state.\n\n8. **Not Cleaning Up Subscriptions/Timers**\n   - Failing to clean up subscriptions, event listeners, or timers in `useEffect` or lifecycle methods can cause memory leaks and unwanted side effects.\n\n9. **Duplicating Logic Across Components**\n   - Copy-pasting logic instead of extracting reusable hooks or components leads to code duplication and maintenance headaches.\n\n10. **Ignoring Error Boundaries**\n    - Not using error boundaries to catch JavaScript errors in the component tree can cause the entire app to crash unexpectedly.\n\n**References:**\n- [React Docs: State and Lifecycle](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory)\n- [React Docs: Lists and Keys](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)\n- [React Docs: Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)\n- [React Docs: Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)",

These custom hooks can then be shared across multiple components, reducing duplication and making your codebase more maintainable.\n\n### How Custom Hooks Promote Code Reuse\n\n- **Encapsulation of Logic:** You can move complex logic (such as fetching data, form handling, or subscribing to events) into a custom hook, keeping your components clean and focused on rendering UI.\n- **Reusability:** Once created, a custom hook can be imported and used in any functional component, allowing you to reuse the same logic in different parts of your application.\n- **Consistency:** By centralizing logic in custom hooks, you ensure consistent behavior across components that use the same hook.\n- **Testability:** Custom hooks can be tested independently, making it easier to verify and maintain your business logic.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\n// useFetch.js\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        setData(data);\n        setLoading(false);\n      });\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading };\n}\n\nexport default useFetch;\n```\n\n```jsx\n// ComponentA.js\nimport useFetch from './useFetch';\n\nfunction ComponentA() {\n  const { data, loading } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/dataA');\n  // ...render logic\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// ComponentB.js\nimport useFetch from './useFetch';\n\nfunction ComponentB() {\n  const { data, loading } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/dataB');\n  // ...render logic\n}\n```\n\n**In summary:**  \nCustom hooks abstract away reusable logic, making it easy to share and maintain code across multiple components, which is a core principle of effective code reuse in React applications.",

        "question": "What is the Portal pattern and when should you use it?",
        "answer": "```markdown **Portal Pattern in React**\n\nThe **Portal pattern** is a design technique in React that allows you to render a component’s children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the parent component. React provides the `ReactDOM.createPortal` API for this purpose.\n\n### How it Works\n\nNormally, React components render into their parent’s DOM hierarchy. With portals, you can render children into a different part of the DOM tree, typically outside the root app element.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nfunction Modal({ children }) {\n  return ReactDOM.createPortal(\n    <div className=\"modal\">{children}</div>,\n    document.getElementById('modal-root')\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### When to Use the Portal Pattern\n\nUse the Portal pattern when you need to:\n\n- **Render components outside the main DOM hierarchy**  \n  For example, modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and popovers often need to visually \"break out\" of their parent containers to avoid CSS overflow and stacking context issues.\n\n- **Avoid CSS conflicts**  \n  Portals help prevent issues with `z-index`, `overflow: hidden`, or other CSS rules that might hide or clip content.\n\n- **Maintain accessibility**  \n  Portals can help ensure that interactive elements like modals are properly announced by screen readers and are focus-trapped.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Modals and dialogs\n- Tooltips and popovers\n- Dropdown menus\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Use Case           | Why Use Portal?                                  |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Modal/Dialog       | Avoids being clipped by parent containers        |\n| Tooltip/Popover    | Ensures correct positioning and stacking         |\n| Dropdown Menu      | Renders above other content, not inside parents  |\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Portal pattern is ideal when you need to render components outside their parent’s DOM hierarchy, especially for UI elements that overlay other content or need to escape CSS constraints.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Input Pattern in React Form Handling\n\n#### Controlled Inputs\n\n- **Definition:** In a controlled component, form data is handled by the React component state.\n- **How it Works:** The value of the input is set by the state, and any change to the input updates the state via an `onChange` handler.\n- **Example:**\n  ```jsx\n  function ControlledInput() {\n    const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n    return (\n      <input\n        value={value}\n        onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  ```\n- **Pros:**\n  - React has full control over the input value.\n  - Easy to validate, format, or manipulate input data.\n  - State is the single source of truth.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Can be verbose for large forms.\n  - May have performance implications with many inputs due to frequent re-renders.\n\n#### Uncontrolled Inputs\n\n- **Definition:** In an uncontrolled component, form data is handled by the DOM itself.\n- **How it Works:** The input value is accessed using a ref, and React does not manage its state.\n- **Example:**\n  ```jsx\n  function UncontrolledInput() {\n    const inputRef = React.useRef();\n    const handleSubmit = () => {\n      alert(inputRef.current.value);\n    };\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input ref={inputRef} />\n        <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n  ```\n- **Pros:**\n  - Less code for simple forms.\n  - Potentially better performance for large forms.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Harder to validate or manipulate input values in real-time.\n  - State is not in sync with the UI, making it less predictable.\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Pattern         | Data Source    | Use Case                        | Pros                         | Cons                        |\n|-----------------|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Controlled      | React State   | Complex forms, validation needed | Predictable, easy validation | More code, possible perf hit|\n| Uncontrolled    | DOM (ref)     | Simple forms, quick prototyping  | Less code, faster for many   | Harder validation, less sync|\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n- **Controlled inputs** are preferred when you need to validate, manipulate, or keep the form data in sync with your application state.\n- **Uncontrolled inputs** are suitable for simple forms or when you want to avoid the overhead of managing state for every input.\n\nChoosing the right pattern depends on the complexity and requirements of your form.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Provider-Consumer Pattern in React\n\nThe **Provider-Consumer pattern** is a design pattern used in React for sharing data across the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This pattern is most commonly implemented using React's **Context API**.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n- **Provider:** A component that supplies (or \"provides\") a certain value (such as state, functions, or objects) to its descendants via React's context mechanism.\n- **Consumer:** Any component that needs access to the value provided by the Provider. It \"consumes\" the context value.\n\n#### Relation to Context API\n\nThe Context API in React is the built-in way to implement the Provider-Consumer pattern. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Create a Context:**\n   ```jsx\n   const MyContext = React.createContext();\n   ```\n\n2. **Provider Component:**\n   Wrap a part of your component tree with the Provider and pass the value you want to share.\n   ```jsx\n   <MyContext.Provider value={sharedValue}>\n     <ChildComponent />\n   </MyContext.Provider>\n   ```\n\n3. **Consumer Component:**\n   Any descendant can access the context value using:\n   - The `useContext` hook (for function components):\n     ```jsx\n     const value = useContext(MyContext);\n     ```\n   - Or the `<MyContext.Consumer>` component (for class components or older code):\n     ```jsx\n     <MyContext.Consumer>\n       {value => /* render something based on the context value */}\n     </MyContext.Consumer>\n     ```\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Avoids prop drilling:** No need to pass props through every intermediate component.\n- **Centralizes shared state:** Useful for themes, authentication, user settings, etc.\n\n#### Example\n\n```jsx\n// Create context\nconst ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');\n\n// Provider\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">\n      <Toolbar />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Consumer\nfunction Toolbar() {\n  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return <div>The current theme is {theme}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Provider-Consumer pattern is a way to share data across components using the Context API, where the Provider supplies the data and Consumers access it, enabling more maintainable and scalable React applications.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Using the Command Pattern in React for Handling User Actions\n\nThe **Command pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. In React, this pattern can be particularly useful for handling user actions in a decoupled and scalable way.\n\n#### How to Implement the Command Pattern in React\n\n1. **Define Command Interfaces/Classes**\n\n   Create command classes or objects that encapsulate the action to be performed.\n\n   ```js\n   // Command Interface\n   class Command {\n     execute() {}\n     undo() {}\n   }\n\n   // Concrete Command\n   class IncrementCommand extends Command {\n     constructor(receiver) {\n       super();\n       this.receiver = receiver;\n     }\n     execute() {\n       this.receiver.increment();\n     }\n     undo() {\n       this.receiver.decrement();\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Receiver**\n\n   The receiver is the object that performs the actual action.\n\n   ```js\n   class CounterReceiver {\n     constructor(setCount) {\n       this.setCount = setCount;\n     }\n     increment() {\n       this.setCount(prev => prev + 1);\n     }\n     decrement() {\n       this.setCount(prev => prev - 1);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Invoker Component**\n\n   The invoker is responsible for executing commands and managing command history (for undo/redo).\n\n   ```js\n   import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';\n\n   function Counter() {\n     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n     const history = useRef([]);\n     const receiver = new CounterReceiver(setCount);\n\n     const handleIncrement = () => {\n       const command = new IncrementCommand(receiver);\n       command.execute();\n       history.current.push(command);\n     };\n\n     const handleUndo = () => {\n       const command = history.current.pop();\n       if (command) command.undo();\n     };\n\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <p>Count: {count}</p>\n         <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>\n         <button onClick={handleUndo}>Undo</button>\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n#### Benefits in React\n\n- **Decouples UI from business logic:** Actions are encapsulated in command objects, making the UI components simpler.\n- **Easier to implement undo/redo:** By keeping a history of commands, you can easily implement undo/redo functionality.\n- **Flexible and scalable:** Adding new actions is as simple as creating new command classes.\n\n#### Use Cases\n\n- Complex forms with undo/redo support\n- Command history for collaborative apps\n- Macro recording and playback\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy encapsulating user actions as command objects, the Command pattern in React helps you manage complex interactions, maintain a clean separation of concerns, and implement advanced features like undo/redo with ease.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Mediator Pattern in React\n\nThe **Mediator pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling by centralizing complex communications and control logic between related objects. Instead of objects referring to each other directly, they communicate through a mediator, which handles the interactions.\n\n#### Why Use Mediator in React?\n\nIn React applications, especially large ones, components often need to communicate. Direct parent-child communication is straightforward, but sibling or distant component communication can lead to tightly coupled code or prop drilling. The Mediator pattern helps by centralizing communication, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.\n\n---\n\n### Implementing the Mediator Pattern in React\n\nThere are several ways to implement the Mediator pattern in React:\n\n#### 1. Using Context API as a Mediator\n\nThe React Context API can act as a mediator by providing a shared interface for components to communicate.\n\n```jsx\n// MediatorContext.js\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst MediatorContext = createContext();\n\nexport const useMediator = () => useContext(MediatorContext);\n\nexport const MediatorProvider = ({ children }) => {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n  const sendMessage = (msg) => setMessages((prev) => [...prev, msg]);\n\n  return (\n    <MediatorContext.Provider value={{ messages, sendMessage }}>\n      {children}\n    </MediatorContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n```jsx\n// ComponentA.js\nimport { useMediator } from './MediatorContext';\n\nfunction ComponentA() {\n  const { sendMessage } = useMediator();\n\n  return <button onClick={() => sendMessage('Hello from A!')}>Send</button>;\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// ComponentB.js\nimport { useMediator } from './MediatorContext';\n\nfunction ComponentB() {\n  const { messages } = useMediator();\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {messages.map((msg, i) => <li key={i}>{msg}</li>)}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// App.js\nimport { MediatorProvider } from './MediatorContext';\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA';\nimport ComponentB from './ComponentB';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <MediatorProvider>\n      <ComponentA />\n      <ComponentB />\n    </MediatorProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Using an Event Emitter as a Mediator\n\nAlternatively, an event emitter can act as a mediator for decoupled component communication.\n\n```js\n// mediator.js\nimport mitt from 'mitt';\nexport const mediator = mitt();\n```\n\n```jsx\n// ComponentA.js\nimport { mediator } from './mediator';\n\nfunction ComponentA() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => mediator.emit('notify', 'Hello from A!')}>\n      Send\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// ComponentB.js\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { mediator } from './mediator';\n\nfunction ComponentB() {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    mediator.on('notify', setMessage);\n    return () => mediator.off('notify', setMessage);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <div>{message}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Approach        | Pros                              | Cons                        |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Context API     | Built-in, easy to use, scalable   | May re-render all consumers |\n| Event Emitter   | Decoupled, flexible               | External dependency, harder to trace |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Mediator pattern in React is useful for decoupling components and centralizing communication. The Context API and event emitters are common ways to implement this pattern, improving maintainability and scalability in complex applications.",

        "question": "How does the Proxy pattern help with performance optimization in React?",
        "answer": "```markdown The **Proxy pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In the context of React, the Proxy pattern can be leveraged for performance optimization in several ways:\n\n## 1. **Lazy Loading and Data Fetching**\nA proxy can intercept requests for data or components and delay the actual loading or computation until it's necessary. For example, you can use a proxy to defer fetching data until a component is actually rendered, reducing unnecessary network requests and improving initial load performance.\n\n```js\nconst dataProxy = new Proxy({}, {\n  get(target, prop) {\n    if (!(prop in target)) {\n      // Fetch data only when accessed\n      target[prop] = fetchDataFromAPI(prop);\n    }\n    return target[prop];\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## 2. **Memoization and Caching**\nProxies can be used to cache expensive computations or API responses. When a component requests data, the proxy checks if it's already cached and returns the cached value, avoiding redundant calculations or network calls.\n\n```js\nconst cache = {};\nconst memoizedProxy = new Proxy({}, {\n  get(target, prop) {\n    if (!(prop in cache)) {\n      cache[prop] = expensiveComputation(prop);\n    }\n    return cache[prop];\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## 3. **State Management Optimization**\nIn state management libraries (like Redux or MobX), proxies can be used to track which parts of the state are accessed by components. This enables fine-grained updates and prevents unnecessary re-renders, as only components that depend on changed state are updated.\n\n## 4. **Virtualization**\nFor large lists or grids, proxies can help with virtualization by only rendering items that are currently visible in the viewport. The proxy intercepts access to list items and only provides data for those that need to be rendered.\n\n## 5. **Access Control and Validation**\nProxies can validate or restrict access to certain properties, preventing unnecessary or invalid updates that could trigger costly re-renders.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Use Case                | How Proxy Helps Performance                |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Lazy Loading            | Defers computation/loading until needed    |\n| Memoization/Caching     | Avoids redundant work                      |\n| State Management        | Enables fine-grained updates               |\n| Virtualization          | Renders only what's necessary              |\n| Access Control          | Prevents unnecessary/invalid updates       |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Proxy pattern in React can intercept and control access to data, components, or state, enabling optimizations such as lazy loading, caching, fine-grained updates, and virtualization. This reduces unnecessary computations, network requests, and re-renders, leading to improved performance in React applications.",

Here are advanced design patterns and techniques to prevent them:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Memoization**\n\n- **`React.memo`**  \n  Wrap functional components to prevent re-rendering unless props change.\n  ```jsx\n  const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {\n    // ...\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **`useMemo`**  \n  Memoize expensive calculations within components.\n  ```jsx\n  const computedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(data), [data]);\n  ```\n\n- **`useCallback`**  \n  Memoize callback functions to avoid re-creating them on every render.\n  ```jsx\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    // ...\n  }, [dependency]);\n  ```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Component Splitting (Container/Presentational Pattern)**\n\n- Split components into \"container\" (logic, data-fetching) and \"presentational\" (UI) components.\n- This limits re-renders to only the components whose data actually changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Lifting State Up Judiciously**\n\n- Avoid lifting state higher than necessary.  \n- Keep state as close as possible to the components that use it to minimize the number of components affected by state changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Keyed Lists and Stable Keys**\n\n- Use stable, unique keys for list items to prevent React from unnecessarily re-rendering or re-mounting components.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **PureComponent and shouldComponentUpdate**\n\n- For class components, extend `React.PureComponent` or implement `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent re-renders when props/state haven't changed.\n\n  ```jsx\n  class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {\n    // ...\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Context Optimization**\n\n- Avoid passing frequently changing values through React Context, as it causes all consumers to re-render.\n- Split contexts or use selectors (e.g., `use-context-selector`) to minimize re-renders.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **State Management Libraries**\n\n- Use libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Recoil, which offer selectors and memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders of connected components.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Virtualization**\n\n- For large lists, use windowing/virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`) to only render visible items.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Pattern/Technique         | Usage Example                | Prevents Re-renders By               |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| React.memo               | Functional components        | Skipping re-render if props same     |\n| useMemo/useCallback      | Values/functions in props    | Memoizing values/functions           |\n| PureComponent            | Class components             | Shallow prop/state comparison        |\n| Container/Presentational | Component architecture       | Isolating stateful logic             |\n| Context Optimization     | Context consumers            | Limiting context updates             |\n| State Management         | External state libraries     | Selector-based subscriptions         |\n\n---\n\n**Best Practice:**  \nCombine these patterns based on your application's needs.

        "question": "How can the Decorator pattern be used to enhance React components?",
        "answer": "```markdown The **Decorator pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In React, this pattern can be used to enhance components by wrapping them with additional functionality.\n\n### How the Decorator Pattern Applies to React\n\nIn React, the Decorator pattern is most commonly implemented using **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** or, in some cases, **Hooks**. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced or modified behavior.\n\n#### Example: Using a Higher-Order Component as a Decorator\n\nSuppose you want to add logging functionality to multiple components without modifying their code directly. You can create a decorator HOC:\n\n```jsx\n// withLogger.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction withLogger(WrappedComponent) {\n  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {\n    console.log('Rendering', WrappedComponent.name, 'with props', props);\n    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;\n  };\n}\n\nexport default withLogger;\n```\n\nYou can then \"decorate\" any component:\n\n```jsx\nimport withLogger from './withLogger';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;\n}\n\nexport default withLogger(MyComponent);\n```\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Enhancements are kept separate from the core component logic.\n- **Reusability:** The decorator (HOC) can be reused across multiple components.\n- **Composability:** Multiple decorators can be composed to add several layers of behavior.\n\n#### Other Examples\n\n- **Access control:** Add authentication checks to components.\n- **Theming:** Inject theme props/styles.\n- **Data fetching:** Inject data from APIs.\n\n#### Decorators Syntax (Experimental)\n\nWith Babel and the appropriate plugins, you can use the decorator syntax:\n\n```jsx\n@withLogger\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** The decorator syntax is still a stage 2 proposal and not part of the official JavaScript standard.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Pattern Aspect      | React Implementation            |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Decorator           | Higher-Order Component (HOC)    |\n| Target              | React Component                 |\n| Enhancement         | Additional props, logic, UI     |\n| Usage               | `withEnhancement(Component)`    |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Decorator pattern in React is most effectively implemented using Higher-Order Components, allowing you to enhance or modify components' behavior in a reusable and composable way, without altering their original implementation.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Flux Pattern in React\n\n**Flux** is an architectural pattern developed by Facebook for building client-side web applications. It is designed to address the complexity of managing state and data flow in large-scale React applications. The core idea behind Flux is **unidirectional data flow**, which helps maintain predictable state changes and simplifies debugging.\n\n#### Key Components of Flux\n\n1. **Actions**: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened (e.g., user interactions, API responses).\n2. **Dispatcher**: A central hub that manages all actions and dispatches them to the relevant stores.\n3. **Stores**: Containers for application state and logic. Stores listen for actions dispatched by the dispatcher and update themselves accordingly.\n4. **Views**: React components that listen to stores and re-render when the state changes.\n\n#### Data Flow in Flux\n\n```\nUser Interaction\n      ↓\n   Action\n      ↓\n Dispatcher\n      ↓\n   Store\n      ↓\n   View (React Component)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Relationship to Redux\n\n**Redux** is a popular state management library inspired by Flux, but with some key differences and simplifications:\n\n- **Single Store**: Redux uses a single, immutable store for the entire application state, whereas Flux can have multiple stores.\n- **Reducers**: Instead of stores with mutable state, Redux uses pure functions called reducers to specify how the state changes in response to actions.\n- **No Dispatcher**: Redux eliminates the need for a central dispatcher; actions are sent directly to the store.\n- **Middleware**: Redux introduces middleware for handling side effects, such as asynchronous actions.\n\n#### Redux Data Flow\n\n```\nAction\n  ↓\nReducer\n  ↓\nStore\n  ↓\nView (React Component)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect         | Flux                              | Redux                           |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Stores         | Multiple, mutable                 | Single, immutable                |\n| Dispatcher     | Required                          | Not used                         |\n| State Changes  | Handled in stores                 | Handled by reducers              |\n| Data Flow      | Unidirectional                    | Unidirectional                   |\n| Middleware     | Not built-in                      | Core concept                     |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFlux introduced the concept of unidirectional data flow to manage state in React apps. Redux builds on Flux’s ideas, simplifying the architecture by using a single store, pure reducers, and removing the dispatcher. Both patterns aim to make state management more predictable and maintainable in complex applications.",

        "question": "How does the Micro-Frontend pattern work in React applications?",
        "answer": "```markdown The **Micro-Frontend** pattern is an architectural approach that extends the concepts of microservices to the frontend world. It enables large applications to be broken down into smaller, independently developed, tested, and deployed frontend applications (micro-frontends), which are then composed together to form a cohesive user experience.\n\n---\n\n## How Micro-Frontend Pattern Works in React Applications\n\n### 1. **Decomposition**\n- The application is split into multiple, self-contained React applications (micro-frontends).\n- Each micro-frontend is responsible for a specific business domain or feature (e.g., cart, product listing, user profile).\n\n### 2. **Independent Development & Deployment**\n- Teams can develop, test, and deploy their micro-frontends independently.\n- Each micro-frontend can use its own build tools, dependencies, and even different versions of React if needed.\n\n### 3. **Integration Strategies**\nThere are several ways to integrate micro-frontends in React:\n\n#### a. **Client-side Composition**\n- The main container (host) application loads micro-frontends at runtime using dynamic imports, iframes, or JavaScript modules.\n- Libraries like [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) or [Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) (Webpack 5) are commonly used.\n\n#### b. **Server-side Composition**\n- The server assembles the HTML for different micro-frontends before sending it to the client.\n- Useful for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) scenarios.\n\n#### c. **Build-time Integration**\n- Micro-frontends are built separately and then combined at build time into a single bundle.\n- Less flexible, but simpler to implement for smaller teams.\n\n### 4. **Communication Between Micro-Frontends**\n- Communication is handled via custom events, shared state (using context providers), or global event buses.\n- It's important to keep coupling low to maintain independence.\n\n### 5. **Shared Dependencies**\n- To avoid duplication, shared libraries (like React) can be externalized and loaded once by the host application, especially when using Module Federation.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Using Module Federation\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js for a micro-frontend\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    new ModuleFederationPlugin({\n      name: \"cart\",\n      filename: \"remoteEntry.js\",\n      exposes: {\n        \"./CartApp\": \"./src/CartApp\",\n      },\n      shared: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nIn the host application, you can dynamically load the remote component:\n\n```js\nconst CartApp = React.lazy(() => import(\"cart/CartApp\"));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n      <CartApp />\n    </React.Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Benefits**\n- **Scalability:** Teams can work independently and scale development.\n- **Flexibility:** Different tech stacks or React versions can coexist.\n- **Resilience:** Failures in one micro-frontend don't break the whole app.\n\n## **Challenges**\n- **Complexity:** Orchestration, routing, and shared state management become more complex.\n- **Performance:** Multiple bundles and runtime integration can impact performance if not optimized.\n- **Consistency:** Ensuring a unified look and feel across micro-frontends requires coordination.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Micro-Frontend pattern in React enables large-scale applications to be modular, scalable, and maintainable by splitting the frontend into independently developed and deployed React applications, which are then composed together using integration strategies like Module Federation, single-spa, or server-side composition.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Best Practices for Composing Multiple Design Patterns in a Large React App\n\nComposing multiple design patterns in a large React application is essential for maintainability, scalability, and code clarity. Here are some best practices to follow:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Separation of Concerns**\n- **Organize by Feature, Not Type:** Structure your codebase around features or domains rather than technical types (e.g., keep all files related to a feature together: components, hooks, contexts, etc.).\n- **Encapsulate Logic:** Use custom hooks, higher-order components (HOCs), or render props to encapsulate reusable logic.\n\n#### 2. **Use the Right Pattern for the Right Problem**\n- **Container/Presentational Pattern:** Use container components for data fetching and state management, and presentational components for UI rendering.\n- **Compound Components:** For complex, interrelated UI (e.g., Tabs, Accordions), use the compound component pattern to provide a flexible API.\n- **Provider Pattern:** Use React Context for global state or shared logic, but avoid overusing it for local state.\n\n#### 3. **Composition Over Inheritance**\n- **Component Composition:** Prefer composing components together rather than deep inheritance trees. Use children, slots, or render props to inject behavior/UI.\n- **Reusable Hooks:** Extract shared logic into custom hooks for easy reuse across components.\n\n#### 4. **Clear Boundaries and Contracts**\n- **Prop Types/TypeScript:** Use PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces to define clear contracts for your components and hooks.\n- **Explicit APIs:** Design components and hooks with clear, minimal, and explicit APIs.\n\n#### 5. **Consistent State Management**\n- **Single Source of Truth:** Use state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Recoil, etc.) or React Context for shared state, and keep local state within components when possible.\n- **Avoid Prop Drilling:** Use context or state management libraries to avoid deeply nested prop passing.\n\n#### 6. **Layered Architecture**\n- **Presentation Layer:** Stateless, UI-focused components.\n- **Container Layer:** Components responsible for data fetching and state.\n- **Service Layer:** Abstract API calls and business logic into separate modules/services.\n\n#### 7. **Testing and Documentation**\n- **Test Patterns in Isolation:** Write unit tests for hooks, HOCs, and context providers independently.\n- **Document Usage:** Provide documentation/examples for custom patterns to help team members understand and use them correctly.\n\n#### 8. **Performance Optimization**\n- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary renders.\n- **Lazy Loading:** Split code and load components lazily where appropriate.\n\n#### 9. **Consistent Naming and File Structure**\n- **Naming Conventions:** Use consistent naming for files and components to make patterns easily recognizable.\n- **Directory Structure:** Group related files (components, hooks, styles) by feature.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Combining Patterns\n\n```jsx\n// Feature: UserProfile\n\n// UserProfileContext.js (Provider Pattern)\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\nconst UserProfileContext = createContext();\nexport const useUserProfile = () => useContext(UserProfileContext);\n\nexport function UserProfileProvider({ children }) {\n  const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null);\n  // ...fetch logic\n  return (\n    <UserProfileContext.Provider value={{ profile, setProfile }}>\n      {children}\n    </UserProfileContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// useUserData.js (Custom Hook)\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\nexport function useUserData(userId) {\n  // ...fetch user data logic\n}\n\n// UserProfile.js (Presentational Component)\nexport function UserProfile({ profile }) {\n  return <div>{profile.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// UserProfileContainer.js (Container Component)\nimport { useUserData } from './useUserData';\nimport { UserProfile } from './UserProfile';\n\nexport function UserProfileContainer({ userId }) {\n  const profile = useUserData(userId);\n  return <UserProfile profile={profile} />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Pattern                | Use Case                                  |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Custom Hooks           | Reusable logic                            |\n| Context/Provider       | Shared/global state                       |\n| Container/Presentational| Separation of data/UI                    |\n| Compound Components    | Interrelated UI elements                  |\n| HOC/Render Props       | Cross-cutting concerns (e.g., auth, theming) |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nCombine patterns thoughtfully, maintain clear boundaries, document your approach, and always prioritize readability and maintainability as your app grows.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing the Publish-Subscribe Pattern in React\n\nThe **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) pattern** decouples components by allowing them to communicate through a central event bus. In React, this is useful for cross-component communication without prop drilling or context.\n\n#### 1. Simple Event Bus Implementation\n\nYou can create a lightweight event bus using JavaScript's built-in features:\n\n```js\n// eventBus.js\nconst listeners = {};\n\nexport const eventBus = {\n  subscribe(event, callback) {\n    if (!listeners[event]) listeners[event] = [];\n    listeners[event].push(callback);\n    return () => {\n      listeners[event] = listeners[event].filter(cb => cb !== callback);\n    };\n  },\n  publish(event, data) {\n    if (!listeners[event]) return;\n    listeners[event].forEach(callback => callback(data));\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Usage in React Components\n\n**Publisher Component:**\n\n```jsx\nimport { eventBus } from './eventBus';\n\nfunction Publisher() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    eventBus.publish('customEvent', { message: 'Hello from Publisher!' });\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Publish Event</button>;\n}\n```\n\n**Subscriber Component:**\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { eventBus } from './eventBus';\n\nfunction Subscriber() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = eventBus.subscribe('customEvent', (data) => {\n      alert(data.message);\n    });\n    return unsubscribe; // Clean up subscription on unmount\n  }, []);\n\n  return <div>Subscriber is listening...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Notes & Best Practices\n\n- Always clean up subscriptions to avoid memory leaks.\n- For larger apps, consider libraries like [mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt) or [eventemitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3).\n- For global state, React Context or state management libraries (Redux, Zustand) may be more appropriate.\n\n#### 4. Example with mitt\n\n```js\n// eventBus.js\nimport mitt from 'mitt';\nexport const eventBus = mitt();\n```\n\n```jsx\n// Usage is similar: eventBus.emit('event', data) and eventBus.on('event', handler)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Publish-Subscribe pattern in React can be implemented using a custom event bus or third-party libraries, enabling decoupled communication between components.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Inversion of Control (IoC) Pattern in React\n\n**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle in which the control of object creation and flow of a program is inverted compared to traditional procedural programming. Instead of the application code calling into a library, the framework or higher-order component calls into the application code. This allows for greater flexibility, decoupling, and reusability.\n\n#### Application of IoC in React\n\nIn React, IoC is commonly achieved through patterns such as **render props**, **higher-order components (HOCs)**, and **hooks**. These patterns allow you to delegate control of certain logic or rendering to child components or functions, rather than hard-coding it within a parent component.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Render Props**\n\nA component receives a function as a prop (the \"render prop\") and calls it to determine what to render. The parent component controls the logic, while the child determines the rendering.\n\n```jsx\n// IoC via Render Props\nfunction DataProvider({ render }) {\n  const data = useDataFetching();\n  return render(data);\n}\n\n// Usage\n<DataProvider render={data => (\n  <DisplayComponent data={data} />\n)} />\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**\n\nA function takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced behavior. The HOC controls the logic, while the wrapped component controls the rendering.\n\n```jsx\n// IoC via HOC\nfunction withUser(WrappedComponent) {\n  return function(props) {\n    const user = useUser();\n    return <WrappedComponent user={user} {...props} />;\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst UserProfile = withUser(ProfileComponent);\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Custom Hooks**\n\nHooks encapsulate logic and expose control to the component using them. The hook manages the logic, but the component decides how to use the returned values.\n\n```jsx\n// IoC via Custom Hook\nfunction useCounter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);\n  return { count, increment };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction CounterDisplay() {\n  const { count, increment } = useCounter();\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{count}</span>\n      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Benefits of IoC in React**\n\n- **Decoupling:** Logic and rendering are separated, making components more reusable and testable.\n- **Flexibility:** Components can be composed in different ways, allowing for dynamic behavior.\n- **Reusability:** Shared logic can be abstracted and reused across multiple components.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nIn React, the Inversion of Control pattern is realized through render props, HOCs, and hooks, allowing you to abstract logic away from components and delegate control, leading to more flexible and maintainable codebases.",

In React, this pattern can help decouple components from their dependencies, making code more modular and easier to test.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n1. **Service Registry**: Create a central object or context that holds references to your services (e.g., API clients, logging utilities, configuration objects).\n2. **Registration**: Services are registered with the locator, often at the application's entry point.\n3. **Retrieval**: Components or other services request dependencies from the locator, rather than importing or instantiating them directly.\n\n#### Example Implementation\n\n```jsx\n// serviceLocator.js\nclass ServiceLocator {\n  constructor() {\n    this.services = new Map();\n  }\n\n  register(name, instance) {\n    this.services.set(name, instance);\n  }\n\n  get(name) {\n    return this.services.get(name);\n  }\n}\n\nexport const serviceLocator = new ServiceLocator();\n```\n\n```jsx\n// services/apiService.js\nexport class ApiService {\n  fetchData() {\n    // ...implementation\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// index.js (Entry Point)\nimport { serviceLocator } from './serviceLocator';\nimport { ApiService } from './services/apiService';\n\nserviceLocator.register('apiService', new ApiService());\n```\n\n```jsx\n// MyComponent.jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { serviceLocator } from './serviceLocator';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const apiService = serviceLocator.get('apiService');\n    apiService.fetchData().then(setData);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n#### Using React Context as a Service Locator\n\nA more \"React-friendly\" approach is to use [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) as the service locator:\n\n```jsx\n// ServiceContext.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nexport const ServiceContext = React.createContext(null);\n\n// App.jsx\nimport { ServiceContext } from './ServiceContext';\nimport { ApiService } from './services/apiService';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const services = {\n    apiService: new ApiService(),\n    // ...other services\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ServiceContext.Provider value={services}>\n      <MyComponent />\n    </ServiceContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// MyComponent.jsx\nimport React, { useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { ServiceContext } from './ServiceContext';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { apiService } = useContext(ServiceContext);\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    apiService.fetchData().then(setData);\n  }, [apiService]);\n\n  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n#### Pros and Cons\n\n**Pros:**\n- Decouples components from concrete service implementations.\n- Centralizes service configuration and management.\n- Facilitates testing by allowing easy service mocking.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Can obscure dependencies, making code harder to trace.\n- Overuse may lead to a \"God object\" anti-pattern.\n- Not as explicit as dependency injection via props.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n- When you have multiple services or dependencies used across many components.\n- When you want to swap or mock services easily (e.g., for testing).\n- In large applications where dependency management becomes complex.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Service Locator pattern in React centralizes service management, allowing components to retrieve dependencies from a shared registry or context, promoting decoupling and modularity. However, use it judiciously to avoid hidden dependencies and maintain code clarity.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Composition vs. Inheritance in React Design Patterns**\n\nIn React, **composition** and **inheritance** are two approaches to code reuse and component organization, but React strongly favors composition.\n\n---\n\n### Composition\n\n- **Definition:** Composition means building complex components by combining simpler components. It involves passing components as children or props to other components.\n- **How it works:** You create reusable components and assemble them together, often using props and the special `children` prop.\n- **Example:**\n\n  ```jsx\n  function FancyBorder(props) {\n    return <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>{props.children}</div>;\n  }\n\n  function WelcomeDialog() {\n    return (\n      <FancyBorder color=\"blue\">\n        <h1>Welcome</h1>\n        <p>Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!</p>\n      </FancyBorder>\n    );\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Promotes flexibility and code reuse.\n  - Encourages separation of concerns.\n  - Makes it easier to share behavior between components.\n\n---\n\n### Inheritance\n\n- **Definition:** Inheritance means creating a new component by extending an existing one, inheriting its behavior and possibly overriding or extending it.\n- **How it works:** You use JavaScript's `class` inheritance to create subclasses of React components.\n- **Example:**\n\n  ```jsx\n  class Dialog extends React.Component {\n    // ...base dialog logic\n  }\n\n  class WelcomeDialog extends Dialog {\n    // ...extends or overrides Dialog logic\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - React discourages inheritance for component reuse.\n  - Can lead to tight coupling and less flexible code.\n  - Makes component hierarchies harder to understand and maintain.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect         | Composition                            | Inheritance                         |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| Approach       | Combine components via props/children  | Extend components via class         |\n| Flexibility    | High                                   | Low                                |\n| React's Stance | Recommended                            | Discouraged                        |\n| Code Reuse     | Through props and children             | Through subclassing                |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nReact encourages **composition** over **inheritance** because it leads to more flexible, maintainable, and reusable components. Use composition to share behavior and structure, and avoid inheritance unless absolutely necessary.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Using the Strategy Pattern to Manage Behaviors in React Components\n\nThe **Strategy pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. In React, you can use this pattern to dynamically switch between different behaviors or functionalities in your components, making them more flexible and maintainable.\n\n#### How to Implement the Strategy Pattern in React\n\n1. **Define Strategy Interfaces**  \n   Create a set of interchangeable strategy functions or objects that encapsulate different behaviors.\n\n2. **Pass Strategy as Props**  \n   Pass the desired strategy to your component via props or context.\n\n3. **Delegate Behavior**  \n   Inside your component, delegate the specific behavior to the provided strategy.\n\n---\n\n#### Example: Form Validation Strategies\n\nSuppose you have a `Form` component that can use different validation strategies.\n\n```jsx\n// 1. Define strategies\nconst emailValidation = (value) => /\\S+@\\S+\\.\\S+/.test(value);\nconst phoneValidation = (value) => /^\\d{10}$/.test(value);\n\n// 2. Form component receives strategy as a prop\nfunction Form({ validate }) {\n  const [input, setInput] = React.useState('');\n  const [isValid, setIsValid] = React.useState(true);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    const value = e.target.value;\n    setInput(value);\n    setIsValid(validate(value)); // Delegates to strategy\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input value={input} onChange={handleChange} />\n      {!isValid && <span>Invalid input!</span>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// 3. Use different strategies\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h2>Email Form</h2>\n      <Form validate={emailValidation} />\n\n      <h2>Phone Form</h2>\n      <Form validate={phoneValidation} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps component logic clean by separating behaviors.\n- **Reusability:** Strategies can be reused across multiple components.\n- **Extensibility:** New behaviors can be added without modifying existing components.\n\n#### Other Use Cases\n\n- Sorting or filtering lists with different algorithms.\n- Handling different rendering strategies (e.g., list virtualization).\n- Managing different data fetching or caching policies.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Strategy pattern in React is typically implemented by passing interchangeable functions or objects as props, allowing components to delegate specific behaviors dynamically. This leads to more modular, flexible, and testable code.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Challenges of Using Context API at Scale\n\nThe React Context API is a powerful tool for prop drilling avoidance and global state management. However, when used at scale in large applications, several challenges can arise:\n\n1. **Performance Issues (Unintended Re-renders):**\n   - Any change in the context value causes all consuming components to re-render, regardless of whether they use the changed part of the context.\n   - This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially if the context is large or frequently updated.\n\n2. **Overuse and Tight Coupling:**\n   - Using context for everything can lead to tightly coupled components, making code harder to maintain and test.\n   - Context is best for truly global data (e.g., theme, locale, authentication), not for all state.\n\n3. **Scalability and Maintainability:**\n   - As the application grows, a single context can become a \"God object,\" holding too much unrelated state.\n   - This makes it hard to track which components depend on which parts of the context.\n\n4. **Debugging Complexity:**\n   - Debugging context updates can be challenging, especially when multiple providers and consumers are nested.\n\n---\n\n### How Patterns Can Help\n\nTo address these challenges, several design patterns and best practices can be applied:\n\n#### 1. **Context Splitting (Modular Contexts)**\n   - **Pattern:** Create multiple, smaller contexts for logically grouped state (e.g., AuthContext, ThemeContext, CartContext).\n   - **Benefit:** Reduces unnecessary re-renders and keeps context focused and maintainable.\n\n#### 2. **Selector/Consumer Patterns**\n   - **Pattern:** Use custom hooks or selectors to consume only the necessary slice of context.\n   - **Example:**  \n     ```js\n     const useUser = () => useContext(UserContext).user;\n     ```\n   - **Benefit:** Minimizes re-renders and improves performance.\n\n#### 3. **Memoization**\n   - **Pattern:** Memoize context values using `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary updates.\n   - **Example:**  \n     ```js\n     const value = useMemo(() => ({ user, setUser }), [user]);\n     ```\n   - **Benefit:** Ensures consumers only re-render when relevant data changes.\n\n#### 4. **Provider Composition**\n   - **Pattern:** Compose providers at the root or relevant subtree, rather than nesting deeply.\n   - **Benefit:** Keeps provider trees manageable and improves readability.\n\n#### 5. **State Management Libraries**\n   - **Pattern:** For complex state, use libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Recoil, which offer more granular control over updates.\n   - **Benefit:** Offloads complex state logic and improves scalability.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Challenge                          | Pattern/Best Practice                | Benefit                                 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Unintended re-renders               | Context splitting, selectors, memo   | Improved performance                    |\n| Tight coupling                      | Modular contexts                     | Easier maintenance                      |\n| Scalability/maintainability         | Provider composition, modularization | Cleaner architecture                    |\n| Debugging complexity                | Smaller contexts, custom hooks       | Easier debugging                        |\n| Complex state management            | State management libraries           | Better scalability and control          |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhile the Context API is a valuable tool, using it at scale requires careful design. Applying patterns like context splitting, memoization, and custom hooks can mitigate performance and maintainability issues, ensuring your React application remains scalable and efficient.",

        "answer": "```markdown The **Facade pattern** in React is used to provide a simplified, higher-level interface to a set of complex components or APIs. This pattern helps manage complexity by hiding the intricate details of multiple components and exposing only what is necessary to the consumer.\n\n### How the Facade Pattern Simplifies Complex React Component APIs\n\n- **Abstraction of Complexity:**  \n  The Facade component acts as a wrapper around multiple child components or logic, abstracting away their complex interactions. Consumers interact with a single, unified API instead of dealing with each component individually.\n\n- **Encapsulation:**  \n  Internal details, such as state management, event handling, or data transformation, are encapsulated within the Facade. This reduces the cognitive load for developers using the component.\n\n- **Improved Reusability:**  \n  By providing a consistent interface, the Facade pattern makes it easier to reuse complex logic across different parts of an application.\n\n- **Easier Maintenance:**  \n  Changes to the underlying components or logic can be made within the Facade without affecting the consuming code, leading to better maintainability.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose you have a complex form with multiple input fields, validation logic, and submission handling:\n\n```jsx\n// Without Facade: Consumers must manage each field and logic separately\n<Form>\n  <NameInput />\n  <EmailInput />\n  <PasswordInput />\n  <ValidationMessages />\n  <SubmitButton />\n</Form>\n```\n\n**With Facade:**\n\n```jsx\n// Facade component encapsulates all logic and subcomponents\n<RegistrationForm />\n```\n\n```jsx\n// RegistrationForm.js\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  // Internal state, validation, and handlers\n  // ...\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <NameInput />\n      <EmailInput />\n      <PasswordInput />\n      <ValidationMessages />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Register</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe consumer only needs to use `<RegistrationForm />`, without worrying about the internal details.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Facade pattern in React simplifies complex component APIs by providing a single, easy-to-use interface, hiding internal complexity, and improving code maintainability and reusability.",

        "answer": "```markdown\n## Adapter Pattern in React and Integrating Third-Party Libraries\n\n### What is the Adapter Pattern?\n\nThe **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, enabling code reusability and flexibility by wrapping an existing class or library with a new interface that your application expects.\n\n### Using the Adapter Pattern with Third-Party Libraries in React\n\nWhen integrating third-party libraries into a React application, you may encounter APIs or components that don't fit seamlessly with your app's architecture or data flow. The Adapter pattern helps by creating a wrapper (adapter) component or function that translates your app's data and interactions into the format expected by the third-party library.\n\n#### Example: Adapting a Non-React Chart Library\n\nSuppose you want to use a vanilla JavaScript chart library (e.g., Chart.js) in your React app. Chart.js expects to interact directly with DOM elements, which doesn't align with React's virtual DOM approach. You can create an adapter component to bridge this gap.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport Chart from 'chart.js/auto';\n\n// Adapter Component\nfunction ChartAdapter({ data, options }) {\n  const canvasRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const ctx = canvasRef.current.getContext('2d');\n    const chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {\n      type: 'bar',\n      data,\n      options,\n    });\n\n    // Cleanup on unmount\n    return () => {\n      chartInstance.destroy();\n    };\n  }, [data, options]);\n\n  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst chartData = { /* ... */ };\nconst chartOptions = { /* ... */ };\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <ChartAdapter data={chartData} options={chartOptions} />;\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Encapsulation:** The adapter component encapsulates the third-party library, hiding its implementation details from the rest of your app.\n- **Interface Translation:** It translates your React props (`data`, `options`) into the format required by the library.\n- **Lifecycle Management:** It manages the library's lifecycle (initialization and cleanup) using React's hooks.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Decoupling:** Your app remains decoupled from the third-party library, making it easier to swap libraries in the future.\n- **Reusability:** The adapter can be reused across your app wherever the library is needed.\n- **Maintainability:** Changes in the third-party library's API only require updates in the adapter, not throughout your codebase.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Adapter pattern in React is a powerful way to integrate third-party libraries by wrapping them in components or functions that translate between your app's interface and the library's API, ensuring smooth and maintainable integration.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Implementing Lazy Loading in React Using Design Patterns\n\n**Lazy loading** is a performance optimization technique where components or resources are loaded only when they are needed, rather than upfront. In React, this can be elegantly implemented using the **\"Proxy\"** and **\"Code Splitting\"** design patterns.\n\n#### 1. React's Built-in Lazy Loading\n\nReact provides the `React.lazy()` function and the `<Suspense>` component to implement lazy loading for components:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\n\n// Lazy load the component\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <LazyComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern Used:**  \n- **Proxy Pattern:** `React.lazy()` acts as a proxy, deferring the loading of the actual component until it's rendered.\n- **Code Splitting:** The dynamic `import()` ensures that the component code is split into a separate chunk, loaded only when needed.\n\n#### 2. Custom Lazy Loading with Higher-Order Components (HOC)\n\nYou can create a reusable HOC to lazy load any component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\n\nfunction withLazyLoad(importFunc, fallback = <div>Loading...</div>) {\n  const LazyComponent = React.lazy(importFunc);\n  return (props) => (\n    <Suspense fallback={fallback}>\n      <LazyComponent {...props} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst LazyMyComponent = withLazyLoad(() => import('./MyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <LazyMyComponent />;\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern Used:**  \n- **Higher-Order Component Pattern:** Encapsulates the lazy loading logic, making it reusable and composable.\n\n#### 3. Route-based Lazy Loading\n\nWhen using React Router, lazy loading can be applied to route components:\n\n```jsx\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\n\nconst Home = React.lazy(() => import('./Home'));\nconst About = React.lazy(() => import('./About'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <Routes>\n          <Route path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" element={<About />} />\n        </Routes>\n      </Suspense>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern Used:**  \n- **Code Splitting Pattern:** Each route is split into a separate bundle, loaded only when the route is accessed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Pattern             | Implementation Example                | Benefit                                  |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Proxy               | `React.lazy()`                        | Defers loading until needed              |\n| Code Splitting      | Dynamic `import()`                    | Reduces initial bundle size              |\n| Higher-Order Component | `withLazyLoad` HOC                 | Reusable lazy loading logic              |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nLazy loading in React leverages the Proxy and Code Splitting patterns, often combined with HOCs or Suspense, to optimize performance by loading components only when they're actually needed.\n```\n",

This approach groups all files related to a specific feature together, making the codebase more scalable and maintainable, especially for larger applications.\n\n#### **Typical Structure**\n\n```\nsrc/\n│\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── AuthPage.jsx\n│   │   ├── authSlice.js\n│   │   └── index.js\n│   │\n│   ├── dashboard/\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── DashboardPage.jsx\n│   │   ├── dashboardSlice.js\n│   │   └── index.js\n│   │\n│   └── ...\n│\n├── common/           # Shared utilities, components, hooks, etc.\n│\n├── App.jsx\n├── index.js\n└── ...\n```\n\n#### **Key Points**\n\n- **Each feature** (e.g., `auth`, `dashboard`) has its own folder containing all related files: components, hooks, slices (for Redux), styles, etc.\n- **Shared code** (used by multiple features) goes into a `common/` or `shared/` directory.\n- **Index files** can be used for easier imports and to encapsulate feature exports.\n\n#### **Benefits**\n\n- **Encapsulation:** All logic for a feature is in one place.\n- **Scalability:** Easy to add new features without cluttering the root directories.\n- **Team Collaboration:** Teams can work on different features with minimal conflicts.\n\n#### **Example: Auth Feature Folder**\n\n```\nfeatures/\n└── auth/\n    ├── components/\n    │   └── LoginForm.jsx\n    ├── hooks/\n    │   └── useAuth.js\n    ├── AuthPage.jsx\n    ├── authSlice.js\n    └── index.js\n```\n\n#### **Usage Example**\n\n```jsx\n// features/auth/index.js\nexport { default as AuthPage } from './AuthPage';\nexport * from './hooks/useAuth';\n```\n\n```jsx\n// App.jsx\nimport { AuthPage } from './features/auth';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <AuthPage />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe Feature Folder pattern helps keep your React project modular, organized, and maintainable by grouping files by feature rather than by file type. This is especially beneficial as your application grows in size and complexity.",

        "question": "What is the role of the Template pattern in React component design?",
        "answer": "```markdown The **Template pattern** in React component design is used to define the structure of a component while allowing certain parts of it to be customized or filled in by child components or functions. This pattern promotes code reuse, separation of concerns, and flexibility in UI composition.\n\n### Role of the Template Pattern in React\n\n- **Separation of Structure and Content**: The Template pattern enables you to separate the static structure (layout, wrappers, etc.) from the dynamic content (children, render props).\n- **Reusable Layouts**: You can create generic layout components (templates) that can be reused with different content, reducing code duplication.\n- **Customization Points**: By exposing \"slots\" (via props like children or render props), you allow consumers of the component to inject custom content or behavior.\n\n### Common Implementations in React\n\n1. **Children as a Slot**\n   ```jsx\n   function Card({ children }) {\n     return (\n       <div className=\"card\">\n         <div className=\"card-content\">{children}</div>\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n\n   // Usage\n   <Card>\n     <h2>Title</h2>\n     <p>Description goes here.</p>\n   </Card>\n   ```\n\n2. **Render Props**\n   ```jsx\n   function ListTemplate({ items, renderItem }) {\n     return (\n       <ul>\n         {items.map(item => (\n           <li key={item.id}>{renderItem(item)}</li>\n         ))}\n       </ul>\n     );\n   }\n\n   // Usage\n   <ListTemplate\n     items={users}\n     renderItem={user => <span>{user.name}</span>}\n   />\n   ```\n\n3. **Component Composition**\n   ```jsx\n   function PageTemplate({ Header, Content, Footer }) {\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <Header />\n         <Content />\n         <Footer />\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Flexibility**: Consumers can customize the content without modifying the template.\n- **Maintainability**: Changes to the layout or structure are centralized in the template component.\n- **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent structure across different parts of the application.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                | Description                                      |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose               | Separate structure from content                  |\n| Implementation        | Children, render props, component composition    |\n| Benefits              | Reusability, flexibility, maintainability        |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Template pattern in React allows you to define reusable component structures with customizable content, leading to more maintainable and flexible UI codebases.",

        "question": "How can you use the Observer pattern to manage subscriptions in React?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Using the Observer Pattern to Manage Subscriptions in React\n\nThe **Observer pattern** is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the *subject*) maintains a list of dependents (*observers*) and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. In React, this pattern can be leveraged to manage subscriptions and propagate state changes efficiently, especially outside of React's built-in state management.\n\n#### Practical Implementation\n\nSuppose you have a data source (e.g., a store or a service) that multiple components need to subscribe to. You can implement the Observer pattern as follows:\n\n#### 1. Create an Observable Store\n\n```js\n// observableStore.js\nclass ObservableStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { count: 0 };\n    this.observers = [];\n  }\n\n  subscribe(observer) {\n    this.observers.push(observer);\n    // Return unsubscribe function\n    return () => {\n      this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);\n    };\n  }\n\n  setState(newState) {\n    this.state = { ...this.state, ...newState };\n    this.notify();\n  }\n\n  notify() {\n    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer(this.state));\n  }\n\n  increment() {\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n  }\n}\n\nexport const store = new ObservableStore();\n```\n\n#### 2. Use the Store in React Components\n\n```js\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { store } from './observableStore';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(store.state.count);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Subscribe to store updates\n    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(state => setCount(state.count));\n    // Cleanup subscription on unmount\n    return unsubscribe;\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => store.increment()}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Benefits\n\n- **Decoupling:** Components don't need to know about each other, only about the store.\n- **Multiple Subscribers:** Any number of components can subscribe to the same store.\n- **Manual Control:** You can control when and how updates are propagated.\n\n#### 4. Real-world Examples\n\n- Libraries like **MobX** and **RxJS** use the Observer pattern to manage state and subscriptions in React applications.\n- The pattern is useful for custom event systems, global stores, or integrating with non-React data sources.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy implementing the Observer pattern, you can create a subscription-based data flow in React, allowing components to react to external state changes efficiently and cleanly.\n```\n",

        "question": "What are the key differences between classic OOP design patterns and their React implementations?",
        "answer": "```markdown **Key Differences Between Classic OOP Design Patterns and Their React Implementations**\n\n1. **Component-Based Architecture vs. Class Hierarchies**\n   - **OOP:** Patterns like Factory, Singleton, or Observer are implemented using class hierarchies and inheritance.\n   - **React:** Patterns are realized through composition of components and hooks, favoring functional programming over inheritance.\n\n2. **State Management**\n   - **OOP:** State is encapsulated within objects; patterns like Memento or State manage object state directly.\n   - **React:** State is managed via hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`) or external libraries (Redux, Zustand), often at the component or application level.\n\n3. **Composition Over Inheritance**\n   - **OOP:** Inheritance is a primary mechanism for code reuse (e.g., Template Method, Strategy).\n   - **React:** Composition is preferred. Higher-Order Components (HOCs), Render Props, and custom hooks enable code reuse without inheritance.\n\n4. **Immutability**\n   - **OOP:** Objects are often mutable; patterns may rely on changing object state.\n   - **React:** Immutability is encouraged for state and props, enabling predictable UI updates and efficient rendering.\n\n5. **Declarative vs. Imperative**\n   - **OOP:** Patterns often involve imperative logic (explicit instructions on how to perform tasks).\n   - **React:** Patterns are adapted to a declarative paradigm, describing what the UI should look like for a given state.\n\n6. **Lifecycle Management**\n   - **OOP:** Object lifecycle is managed manually or by frameworks.\n   - **React:** Component lifecycle is managed by React itself, with hooks like `useEffect` replacing classic lifecycle methods.\n\n7. **Context and Dependency Injection**\n   - **OOP:** Dependency Injection pattern is used to manage dependencies.\n   - **React:** The Context API provides a way to inject dependencies (data, functions) into the component tree.\n\n8. **Event Handling**\n   - **OOP:** Observer pattern is used for event subscription and notification.\n   - **React:** Event handling is built-in and declarative; context or state management libraries can be used for cross-component communication.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                | Classic OOP Patterns                | React Implementations                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Code Reuse            | Inheritance                         | Composition (HOCs, hooks, render props)|\n| State Management      | Encapsulated in objects             | Hooks, context, external libraries     |\n| Mutability            | Often mutable                       | Prefer immutable state                 |\n| Paradigm              | Imperative                          | Declarative                            |\n| Lifecycle             | Manual or framework-managed         | React-managed, via hooks               |\n| Dependency Injection  | Explicit pattern                    | Context API                            |\n| Event Handling        | Observer pattern                    | Built-in, context/state                |\n\n**References**\n- [React Patterns](https://reactpatterns.com/)\n- [Design Patterns in React](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/react)\n- [React Docs: Composition vs Inheritance](https://react.dev/learn/composition-vs-inheritance)",
