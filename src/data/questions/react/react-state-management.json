        "answer": "```markdown A **controlled component** in React is a component whose form data (such as the value of an input field) is managed by the component's state. In other words, React state is the \"single source of truth\" for the input's value, and any changes to the input are handled by updating the state.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction ControlledInput() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState('');\n\n  const handleChange = (event) => {\n    setValue(event.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <input type=\"text\" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- The input's value is set by the React state (`value={value}`).\n- Any change to the input updates the state (`onChange={handleChange}`).\n- This allows React to fully control the input's value.\n\n**Controlled components** are useful for validating user input, conditionally enabling/disabling buttons, and handling form submissions in a predictable way.",

It represents information about the component that can change over time, such as user input, fetched data, or UI toggles. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state.\n\nIn functional components, you can use the `useState` hook to create and update state:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- State is local to the component.\n- State changes trigger re-renders.\n- Use `useState` in functional components to manage state.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Answer:**\n\nYou should avoid directly mutating the state in React because React relies on detecting changes to state in order to update the UI efficiently. When you mutate the state directly (for example, by changing an object or array in place), React may not recognize that the state has changed, and as a result, the component may not re-render as expected.\n\nInstead, you should always use the state updater functions provided by React (like `setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components). These functions ensure that React knows when the state has changed and can trigger the necessary re-renders.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsx\n// ❌ Don't do this:\nstate.value = 10; // Direct mutation\n\n// ✅ Do this:\nsetState({ value: 10 }); // Correct way\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nAvoid direct mutation to ensure React can properly track state changes and update the UI accordingly.",

        "answer": "```markdown The **Context API** in React is a built-in feature that allows you to share data (state) across the entire component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level (a process known as \"prop drilling\"). It is especially useful for global data such as themes, user authentication, or language settings.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. **Create a Context**\n   ```jsx\n   const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);\n   ```\n\n2. **Provide the Context**\n   Wrap your component tree with the `Provider` and pass the value you want to share:\n   ```jsx\n   <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>\n     <App />\n   </MyContext.Provider>\n   ```\n\n3. **Consume the Context**\n   Any child component can access the context value using:\n   - The `useContext` hook (for functional components):\n     ```jsx\n     const value = useContext(MyContext);\n     ```\n   - The `Context.Consumer` component (for class components or older code):\n     ```jsx\n     <MyContext.Consumer>\n       {value => /* render something based on the context value */}\n     </MyContext.Consumer>\n     ```\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\n// 1. Create Context\nconst ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');\n\n// 2. Provide Context\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">\n      <Toolbar />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// 3. Consume Context\nfunction Toolbar() {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### When to Use Context API\n\n- When you need to share data globally (e.g., user info, theme, locale)\n- When passing props through many layers becomes cumbersome\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Not a replacement for all state management needs (for complex state, consider libraries like Redux or Zustand)\n- Can cause unnecessary re-renders if not used carefully\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Context API is a powerful tool in React for managing and sharing state globally, reducing the need for prop drilling and making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.",

Two core concepts in Recoil are **atoms** and **selectors**.\n\n---\n\n#### Atoms\n\n- **Definition:** Atoms are units of state in Recoil. They represent a piece of state that components can subscribe to and update.\n- **Characteristics:**\n  - Any component that subscribes to an atom will re-render when the atom’s value changes.\n  - Atoms can be read from and written to from any component.\n- **Usage Example:**\n\n  ```js\n  import { atom } from 'recoil';\n\n  export const counterState = atom({\n    key: 'counterState', // unique ID (with respect to other atoms/selectors)\n    default: 0,          // default value (initial value)\n  });\n  ```\n\n---\n\n#### Selectors\n\n- **Definition:** Selectors are pure functions that derive state from atoms or other selectors.

        "answer": "```markdown ### Using the `useContext` Hook in React\n\nThe `useContext` hook allows you to access the value of a React Context directly in your functional components, avoiding the need for nested `<Context.Consumer>` components.\n\n#### Steps to Use `useContext`\n\n1. **Create a Context**\n   ```jsx\n   import React, { createContext } from 'react';\n\n   const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue);\n   ```\n\n2. **Provide a Context Value**\n   Wrap your component tree (or a part of it) with the Context Provider and pass a value.\n   ```jsx\n   <MyContext.Provider value={someValue}>\n     <MyComponent />\n   </MyContext.Provider>\n   ```\n\n3. **Consume Context with `useContext`**\n   Inside any child component, use the `useContext` hook to access the context value.\n   ```jsx\n   import React, { useContext } from 'react';\n\n   function MyComponent() {\n     const value = useContext(MyContext);\n     return <div>{value}</div>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n#### Example\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\n// 1. Create Context\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nfunction ThemedButton() {\n  // 2. Use useContext to consume the context value\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    // 3. Provide a value to the context\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">\n      <ThemedButton />\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- `useContext` takes the context object returned by `createContext` and returns the current context value.\n- The value returned is determined by the nearest `<Context.Provider>` above the component in the tree.\n- If there is no Provider, it returns the default value passed to `createContext`.\n\n**Note:** Changing the context value will cause all consuming components to re-render.",

        "answer": "```markdown **Prop drilling** is a situation in React where you pass data (props) from a parent component down to deeply nested child components, even if intermediate components do not need that data, just to reach the component that does. This can make your code harder to maintain and understand, especially as your component tree grows.\n\n### Example of Prop Drilling\n\n```jsx\nfunction Grandparent() {\n  const user = { name: \"Alice\" };\n  return <Parent user={user} />;\n}\n\nfunction Parent({ user }) {\n  return <Child user={user} />;\n}\n\nfunction Child({ user }) {\n  return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `user` prop is passed through `Parent` even though only `Child` uses it.\n\n---\n\n## How to Avoid Prop Drilling\n\n1. **React Context API**  \n   The Context API allows you to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level.\n\n   ```jsx\n   const UserContext = React.createContext();\n\n   function Grandparent() {\n     const user = { name: \"Alice\" };\n     return (\n       <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n         <Parent />\n       </UserContext.Provider>\n     );\n   }\n\n   function Parent() {\n     return <Child />;\n   }\n\n   function Child() {\n     const user = React.useContext(UserContext);\n     return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **State Management Libraries**  \n   Libraries like Redux, MobX, or Zustand can manage global state outside the component tree, making data accessible anywhere without prop drilling.\n\n3. **Component Composition**  \n   Sometimes, restructuring your components or using render props/HOCs can help avoid unnecessary prop passing.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Method                   | Description                                  |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| React Context API        | Share data globally without passing props    |\n| State Management Library | Manage global state outside React components |\n| Component Composition    | Restructure components to minimize drilling  |\n\n---\n\n**In short:** Prop drilling is passing props through many layers unnecessarily.

        "question": "How does Redux manage state in a React application?",
        "answer": "```markdown Redux manages state in a React application by providing a centralized store that holds the entire state of the app. Here’s how it works:\n\n### 1. **Single Source of Truth**\nRedux maintains the application state in a single JavaScript object called the **store**. This makes it easier to track and manage state across the entire app.\n\n### 2. **State is Read-Only**\nThe only way to change the state is by dispatching **actions**. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened (e.g., `{ type: 'INCREMENT' }`).\n\n### 3. **Pure Functions (Reducers)**\nReducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They specify how the state changes in response to actions.\n\n```js\nfunction counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Dispatching Actions**\nComponents dispatch actions using the `dispatch` function. Redux then sends these actions to the reducer to update the state.\n\n```js\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });\n```\n\n### 5. **Connecting React and Redux**\nReact components connect to the Redux store using the `react-redux` library. The `Provider` component makes the store available to all components, and the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks allow components to access state and dispatch actions.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{count}</span>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nRedux manages state in a React application by keeping all state in a single store, updating it through dispatched actions and reducers, and connecting React components to the store using special hooks or higher-order components. This approach makes state predictable, easier to debug, and consistent across the application.",

This function receives the entire Redux state and returns the piece of state you want.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useSelector } from 'react-redux';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  // Select a specific piece of state from the Redux store\n  const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);\n\n  return <div>Counter: {counter}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Automatic Subscription:** The component automatically re-renders whenever the selected state changes.\n- **Shallow Comparison:** By default, `useSelector` uses strict (`===`) equality to compare the selected value. If the value changes, the component re-renders.\n- **Multiple Selectors:** You can use `useSelector` multiple times to select different pieces of state.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **No Need for mapStateToProps:** Unlike the older `connect` HOC, `useSelector` is simpler and works directly in function components.\n- **Scoped Updates:** Only the components that use a particular piece of state will re-render when that state changes.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\nconst userName = useSelector((state) => state.user.name);\nconst isLoggedIn = useSelector((state) => state.auth.isLoggedIn);\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n`useSelector` is a powerful hook for accessing Redux state in functional components, making state selection easy and efficient while keeping your components in sync with the store.",

        "question": "What is memoization and how does it help with state management?",
        "answer": "```markdown **Memoization** is an optimization technique used in React (and programming in general) to cache the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. In React, memoization is commonly used to prevent unnecessary computations or re-renders, especially in components that depend on complex calculations or receive frequently changing props.\n\n### How Memoization Helps with State Management\n\n- **Prevents Unnecessary Re-renders:** When state or props change, React components re-render. Memoization (using hooks like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback`) ensures that components or functions only update when their dependencies actually change, reducing the number of renders.\n- **Optimizes Expensive Calculations:** If a component performs heavy computations based on state, memoization caches the result so the calculation only runs when necessary.\n- **Improves Performance:** By minimizing redundant renders and calculations, memoization helps keep the UI responsive, especially in large or complex applications.\n\n### Example\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ExpensiveComponent({ number }) {\n  // Expensive calculation only runs when 'number' changes\n  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    let result = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {\n      result += number;\n    }\n    return result;\n  }, [number]);\n\n  return <div>Computed Value: {computedValue}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `useMemo` memoizes the result of the expensive calculation. If the `number` prop doesn't change, React returns the cached value, avoiding unnecessary recalculations.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** Memoization in React helps manage state efficiently by caching results and preventing unnecessary updates, which leads to better performance and a smoother user experience.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Optimizing Performance When Managing Large State Objects in React\n\nManaging large state objects in React can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially if not handled carefully. Here are advanced strategies to optimize performance:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Split State into Smaller Chunks**\n- **Problem:** Large, monolithic state objects cause unnecessary re-renders when any part changes.\n- **Solution:** Break state into smaller, focused pieces using multiple `useState` or `useReducer` hooks.\n    ```jsx\n    // Instead of:\n    const [state, setState] = useState({ user: {}, posts: [], comments: [] });\n\n    // Use:\n    const [user, setUser] = useState({});\n    const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);\n    const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Use Memoization**\n- **Problem:** Expensive computations or derived state can slow down rendering.\n- **Solution:** Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to memoize values and functions.\n    ```jsx\n    const filteredPosts = useMemo(() => {\n      return posts.filter(post => post.active);\n    }, [posts]);\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Leverage Context Selectors**\n- **Problem:** Using React Context with large state causes all consumers to re-render on any change.\n- **Solution:** Use libraries like [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) to subscribe only to specific parts of the context.\n    ```jsx\n    import { useContextSelector } from 'use-context-selector';\n    const user = useContextSelector(MyContext, ctx => ctx.user);\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Immutable Updates**\n- **Problem:** Mutating state directly prevents React from detecting changes, leading to bugs and unnecessary re-renders.\n- **Solution:** Always create new objects/arrays when updating state.\n    ```jsx\n    setPosts(prevPosts => prevPosts.map(post => \n      post.id === id ? { ...post, title: newTitle } : post\n    ));\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Component Memoization**\n- **Problem:** Parent re-renders cause all child components to re-render, even if their props/state haven’t changed.\n- **Solution:** Use `React.memo` for functional components and `PureComponent` for class components.\n    ```jsx\n    const PostList = React.memo(({ posts }) => { /* ... */ });\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Virtualization**\n- **Problem:** Rendering large lists or tables is expensive.\n- **Solution:** Use libraries like [react-window](https://react-window.vercel.app/) or [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) to render only visible items.\n    ```jsx\n    import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Selective Rendering with Keys**\n- **Problem:** React’s reconciliation can be inefficient with large lists.\n- **Solution:** Use stable and unique keys for list items to help React optimize DOM updates.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Move State Up or Down Appropriately**\n- **Problem:** State that is too high in the component tree causes unnecessary re-renders.\n- **Solution:** Lift state only as high as necessary, or use local state for isolated concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### 9. **Use External State Management Libraries**\n- **Problem:** React’s built-in state tools may not scale for very large or complex state.\n- **Solution:** Use libraries like Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil, which offer fine-grained control and optimizations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Technique                    | Benefit                                 |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Split state                  | Reduces unnecessary re-renders          |\n| Memoization                  | Avoids expensive recalculations         |\n| Context selectors            | Limits re-renders to relevant consumers |\n| Immutable updates            | Ensures change detection                |\n| Component memoization        | Prevents child re-renders               |\n| Virtualization               | Efficiently renders large lists         |\n| Proper key usage             | Optimizes list diffing                  |\n| State lifting                | Minimizes render scope                  |\n| External libraries           | Advanced optimization & scalability     |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nOptimize large state management by splitting state, memoizing computations, using context selectors, ensuring immutability, memoizing components, virtualizing lists, using proper keys, lifting state appropriately, and leveraging external libraries when necessary. These strategies collectively minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve the scalability and responsiveness of your React applications.",

Using global state for local concerns (like form inputs or UI toggles) adds unnecessary complexity and can lead to accidental data leaks between components.\n\n**Best Practices:**  \n- Use global state only for truly shared data (e.g., user authentication, theme).\n- Prefer local state for UI-specific or component-specific data.\n- Modularize state management to keep concerns separated and maintainable.",

        "answer": "```markdown When a component’s state changes in React, the reconciliation algorithm (also known as the “diffing” algorithm) determines how to efficiently update the DOM to reflect those changes. Here’s how the process works:\n\n## 1. State Change Triggers Re-render\n\nWhen you update a component’s state (using `setState` or a state setter from `useState`), React schedules a re-render for that component.\n\n## 2. Virtual DOM Creation\n\nReact creates a new Virtual DOM tree for the component (and its children, if necessary) based on the new state.\n\n## 3. Reconciliation (Diffing)\n\nReact compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one. This process is called reconciliation. The algorithm:\n\n- Traverses both trees in parallel.\n- Compares elements by type and key.\n- Determines which parts of the tree have changed.\n\n## 4. Minimal DOM Updates\n\nBased on the differences found, React calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This minimizes expensive DOM operations, improving performance.\n\n## 5. Commit Phase\n\nReact applies the calculated changes to the real DOM, ensuring the UI reflects the latest state.\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **State changes** are the primary trigger for reconciliation.\n- **Reconciliation** ensures only the necessary DOM updates occur.\n- **Keys** help React identify which elements have changed, been added, or removed.\n- **Efficient updates**: React batches state updates and minimizes DOM mutations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Step                | What Happens                                   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| State Change        | Component state is updated                      |\n| Virtual DOM Update  | New Virtual DOM is generated                    |\n| Reconciliation      | New and old Virtual DOM trees are diffed        |\n| DOM Update          | Minimal set of changes applied to real DOM      |\n\n---\n\n**In essence:**  \nReact’s reconciliation algorithm ensures that when state changes, only the necessary parts of the UI are updated, making React applications efficient and responsive.",

        "answer": "```markdown\nTo implement undo/redo functionality in React state management, you need to maintain a history of state changes.

        "question": "How can you handle asynchronous state updates in Redux?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Handling Asynchronous State Updates in Redux\n\nRedux by itself handles only synchronous state updates. To manage asynchronous operations (like API calls), you need middleware. The most common approaches are:\n\n#### 1. **Redux Thunk**\n\nRedux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can perform asynchronous operations and dispatch actions when they're done.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\n// actions.js\nexport const fetchData = () => {\n  return async (dispatch) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_REQUEST' });\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n      const data = await response.json();\n      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });\n    } catch (error) {\n      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE', error });\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. **Redux Saga**\n\nRedux Saga uses generator functions to handle side effects. Sagas listen for dispatched actions and can perform asynchronous tasks in a more declarative way.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\n// sagas.js\nimport { call, put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';\n\nfunction* fetchDataSaga() {\n  try {\n    const response = yield call(fetch, '/api/data');\n    const data = yield response.json();\n    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });\n  } catch (error) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE', error });\n  }\n}\n\nexport function* watchFetchData() {\n  yield takeEvery('FETCH_DATA_REQUEST', fetchDataSaga);\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Redux Toolkit (RTK) with createAsyncThunk**\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies async logic with `createAsyncThunk`, which automatically generates action types and handles dispatching.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\n// slice.js\nimport { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';\n\nexport const fetchData = createAsyncThunk('data/fetch', async () => {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n  return response.json();\n});\n\nconst dataSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'data',\n  initialState: { value: [], status: 'idle', error: null },\n  reducers: {},\n  extraReducers: (builder) => {\n    builder\n      .addCase(fetchData.pending, (state) => {\n        state.status = 'loading';\n      })\n      .addCase(fetchData.fulfilled, (state, action) => {\n        state.status = 'succeeded';\n        state.value = action.payload;\n      })\n      .addCase(fetchData.rejected, (state, action) => {\n        state.status = 'failed';\n        state.error = action.error.message;\n      });\n  },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nTo handle asynchronous state updates in Redux:\n\n- Use **middleware** like Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, or Redux Toolkit's async utilities.\n- Dispatch actions before, during, and after the async operation to update the state accordingly.\n- Structure your reducers to handle these actions and update the state based on the async operation's status.\n\nThese patterns help keep your Redux logic predictable and maintainable, even with complex asynchronous workflows.\n```\n",

        "question": "What is optimistic UI and how can you implement it with state management?",
        "answer": "```markdown **Optimistic UI** is a technique in React (and other front-end frameworks) where the user interface is updated immediately in response to a user action, before receiving confirmation from the server. This approach makes applications feel faster and more responsive, as users see instant feedback rather than waiting for network requests to complete.\n\n### How Optimistic UI Works\n\n1. **User initiates an action** (e.g., submitting a form, liking a post).\n2. **UI updates immediately** to reflect the expected outcome.\n3. **API request is sent** in the background.\n4. If the **request succeeds**, nothing more needs to be done.\n5. If the **request fails**, the UI is reverted to its previous state and an error is shown.\n\n---\n\n## Implementing Optimistic UI with State Management\n\nYou can implement optimistic UI with React's built-in state management (`useState`, `useReducer`) or with external libraries (like Redux, Zustand, or React Query).\n\n### Example: Optimistically Adding a Todo\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction TodoList({ api }) {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  const addTodo = async (text) => {\n    // 1. Create a temporary todo with a fake ID\n    const tempId = Date.now();\n    const newTodo = { id: tempId, text };\n\n    // 2. Optimistically update the UI\n    setTodos((prev) => [...prev, newTodo]);\n\n    try {\n      // 3. Send request to server\n      const savedTodo = await api.createTodo(text);\n\n      // 4. Replace temp todo with real todo from server\n      setTodos((prev) =>\n        prev.map((todo) => (todo.id === tempId ? savedTodo : todo))\n      );\n    } catch (e) {\n      // 5. On error, revert UI and show error\n      setTodos((prev) => prev.filter((todo) => todo.id !== tempId));\n      setError('Failed to add todo.');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {error && <div>{error}</div>}\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map((todo) => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n      <button onClick={() => addTodo('New Task')}>Add Todo</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **State is updated before the server responds** to provide instant feedback.\n- **Rollback logic** is essential to handle failures gracefully.\n- Optimistic UI can be implemented with any state management solution, but libraries like [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/optimistic-updates) and [Redux Toolkit Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/optimistic-updates) offer built-in support for optimistic updates.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [React Query: Optimistic Updates](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/optimistic-updates)\n- [Redux Toolkit Query: Optimistic Updates](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/optimistic-updates)\n- [Optimistic UI in React – Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/implementing-optimistic-ui-updates-in-react)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nOptimistic UI improves perceived performance by updating the UI before server confirmation. Implement it by updating state immediately, sending the request, and rolling back if the request fails. Always ensure rollback logic is in place to maintain data consistency.",

        "question": "How do you manage state in server-side rendered (SSR) React applications?",
        "answer": "```markdown\nManaging state in server-side rendered (SSR) React applications involves handling both the initial state hydration from the server and subsequent client-side updates. Here’s how you can approach state management in SSR React apps:\n\n## 1. **Initial State Hydration**\n\nWhen rendering on the server, you typically fetch data and generate the initial state. This state is then serialized and embedded into the HTML sent to the client. On the client, React \"hydrates\" the app using this state to ensure consistency between server and client renders.\n\n**Example with Redux:**\n\n- **Server Side:**\n  ```js\n  // Fetch data and create store\n  const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);\n  // Render app to string\n  const html = renderToString(\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <App />\n    </Provider>\n  );\n  // Serialize state and inject into HTML\n  const preloadedState = store.getState();\n  ```\n\n- **Client Side:**\n  ```js\n  // Read the state from the window object\n  const preloadedState = window.__PRELOADED_STATE__;\n  // Create store with preloaded state\n  const store = createStore(reducer, preloadedState);\n  // Hydrate the app\n  hydrate(\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <App />\n    </Provider>,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n  ```\n\n## 2. **State Management Libraries**\n\n- **Redux**: Popular for SSR due to its predictable state container and easy serialization.\n- **Zustand, Jotai, Recoil**: Modern alternatives that can also be used with SSR, but you must ensure state is serializable and properly hydrated.\n- **React Context**: Suitable for simple state, but you need to handle hydration manually.\n\n## 3. **Data Fetching Strategies**\n\n- **Next.js**: Provides built-in SSR support with `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`, or `getStaticProps` for data fetching and state initialization.\n- **Custom SSR Setup**: Fetch data on the server, pass it as props or initial state, and hydrate on the client.\n\n## 4. **Synchronization and Consistency**\n\n- Ensure that the state used to render on the server matches the state used to hydrate on the client to avoid React hydration mismatches.\n- Avoid non-serializable state (like functions or class instances) in the initial state.\n\n## 5. **Example with Next.js and Redux**\n\n```js\n// pages/_app.js\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport store from '../store';\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </Provider>\n  );\n}\nexport default MyApp;\n```\n```js\n// pages/index.js\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data here\n  return { props: { initialData } };\n}\n```\n\n## 6. **Best Practices**\n\n- Use a single source of truth for state (e.g., Redux store).\n- Serialize and deserialize state carefully to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n- Use libraries and frameworks that support SSR natively (e.g., Next.js).\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nState management in SSR React apps requires careful handling of initial state hydration, synchronization between server and client, and the use of serializable state containers. Libraries like Redux and frameworks like Next.js provide robust solutions for these challenges.\n```\n",

        "answer": "```markdown\n### Trade-offs Between Client-side and Server-side State Management in React\n\nManaging state efficiently is crucial in React applications, especially as they scale. Both client-side and server-side state management have their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a breakdown of the trade-offs:\n\n---\n\n#### **Client-side State Management**\n\n**Pros:**\n- **Instant UI Updates:** State changes are immediately reflected in the UI, providing a responsive user experience.\n- **Reduced Server Load:** Frequent state changes (e.g., form inputs, UI toggles) don’t require server communication.\n- **Offline Support:** Applications can function (to some extent) without network connectivity.\n- **Rich Interactivity:** Enables complex local interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, undo/redo).\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Data Consistency:** Multiple clients may have out-of-sync state, leading to stale or conflicting data.\n- **Security Risks:** Sensitive data stored on the client can be exposed or tampered with.\n- **Initial Load Time:** Large client-side state (e.g., Redux stores) can increase bundle size and slow down initial load.\n- **Persistence:** State is lost on refresh unless explicitly persisted (e.g., localStorage), which can be unreliable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Server-side State Management**\n\n**Pros:**\n- **Single Source of Truth:** Ensures data consistency across all clients.\n- **Security:** Sensitive data is kept on the server, reducing exposure to attacks.\n- **Persistence:** State is durable and survives client reloads or crashes.\n- **Scalability:** Easier to coordinate shared state (e.g., collaborative apps, real-time updates).\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Latency:** UI updates depend on network requests, which can introduce delays.\n- **Increased Server Load:** Frequent state changes can overwhelm the server.\n- **Offline Limitations:** Application functionality is reduced or unavailable without network connectivity.\n- **Complexity:** Requires handling synchronization, caching, and potential conflicts between client and server.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                | Client-side State                  | Server-side State                  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Performance**       | Fast, local updates                | Slower, network-dependent          |\n| **Consistency**       | Can be inconsistent across clients | Consistent, single source of truth |\n| **Security**          | Vulnerable to exposure             | More secure                        |\n| **Persistence**       | Volatile unless persisted locally  | Persistent by default              |\n| **Scalability**       | Good for local state               | Better for shared/global state     |\n| **Offline Support**   | Possible                           | Limited                            |\n\n---\n\n#### **Best Practices**\n\n- **Use client-side state** for UI state, local component data, and temporary values.\n- **Use server-side state** for shared, persistent, or sensitive data.\n- **Hybrid approaches** (e.g., React Query, SWR) can cache server state on the client, offering the best of both worlds.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe choice between client-side and server-side state management depends on the application’s requirements for performance, consistency, security, and user experience. Often, a combination of both is used to balance trade-offs effectively.\n```",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders Caused by State Changes in React\n\nUnnecessary re-renders can negatively impact the performance of React applications. Here are advanced strategies to prevent them:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Use `React.memo` for Functional Components**\nWrap functional components with `React.memo` to memoize them. This prevents re-rendering unless their props change.\n\n```jsx\nconst MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {\n  // Component code\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Optimize Context Usage**\nAvoid passing large or frequently changing values through React Context, as any change will re-render all consuming components. Instead, split context or use selectors.\n\n```jsx\n// Split context into smaller pieces\nconst ThemeContext = React.createContext();\nconst UserContext = React.createContext();\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Leverage `useMemo` and `useCallback`**\nMemoize expensive calculations and functions to avoid re-creating them on every render.\n\n```jsx\nconst memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);\nconst memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { doSomething(a); }, [a]);\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Lift State Only When Necessary**\nKeep state as close as possible to where it is needed. Lifting state up unnecessarily can cause parent and sibling components to re-render.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Use Immutable Data Structures**\nAlways return new objects/arrays when updating state. Mutating state directly can cause React to miss changes or trigger unnecessary renders.\n\n```jsx\nsetItems(prevItems => [...prevItems, newItem]);\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Selective Rendering with `shouldComponentUpdate` or `PureComponent`**\nFor class components, use `shouldComponentUpdate` or extend `React.PureComponent` to prevent re-renders when props/state haven't changed.\n\n```jsx\nclass MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {\n  // Only re-renders if props/state change shallowly\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Key Prop Optimization in Lists**\nUse stable and unique keys in lists to help React identify which items have changed.\n\n```jsx\n{items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Avoid Inline Functions and Objects in JSX**\nInline functions and objects create new references on every render, causing child components to re-render.\n\n```jsx\n// BAD: causes re-renders\n<Component onClick={() => doSomething()} />\n\n// GOOD: use useCallback\nconst handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(), []);\n<Component onClick={handleClick} />\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Technique                  | Usage                                      |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| `React.memo`               | Memoize functional components              |\n| `useMemo` / `useCallback`  | Memoize values and functions               |\n| Context Optimization       | Split context, avoid large/frequent values |\n| State Placement            | Keep state local when possible             |\n| Immutable Updates          | Avoid mutating state directly              |\n| `PureComponent`/`shouldComponentUpdate` | Optimize class components    |\n| Stable Keys                | Use unique keys in lists                   |\n| Avoid Inline Props         | Prevent new references in JSX              |\n\n---\n\nBy combining these techniques, you can significantly reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve the performance of your React applications.",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Role of Immutability in React State Management\n\nImmutability is a core principle in React state management. Its role includes:\n\n1. **Predictable State Updates**  \n   By treating state as immutable, each update creates a new state object rather than modifying the existing one. This makes it easier to track changes and reason about how state evolves over time.\n\n2. **Efficient Change Detection**  \n   React relies on shallow comparison to determine if a component needs to re-render. If state is mutated directly, React may not detect changes, leading to stale UI. Immutability ensures that new references are created when state changes, enabling React to efficiently detect updates.\n\n3. **Time-Travel Debugging and Undo/Redo**  \n   Since each state change results in a new object, it becomes straightforward to implement features like undo/redo or time-travel debugging by keeping a history of state objects.\n\n4. **Avoiding Side Effects**  \n   Mutating state directly can lead to unpredictable bugs and side effects, especially in complex applications. Immutability enforces a clear separation between previous and next states, reducing the risk of unintended consequences.\n\n5. **Integration with Pure Functions**  \n   Immutability aligns with the functional programming paradigm, where pure functions (such as reducers in Redux) return new state objects without side effects, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\n// Incorrect: Mutates state directly\nstate.items.push(newItem);\n\n// Correct: Returns a new array\nsetState(prevState => ({\n  items: [...prevState.items, newItem]\n}));\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nImmutability in React state management ensures reliable UI updates, simplifies debugging, and prevents subtle bugs by making state changes explicit and predictable.",

Here are advanced strategies and best practices:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Leverage React DevTools**\n- **Component Tree Inspection:** Use React DevTools to inspect the component hierarchy and observe state/props at each level.\n- **State & Props Tracking:** Monitor how state and props change over time as you interact with your app.\n- **Highlight Updates:** Enable the “Highlight updates” option to see which components re-render and why.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Use Logging and Breakpoints**\n- **Console Logging:** Temporarily add `console.log` statements to reducers, context providers, or state setters to trace state changes.\n- **Debugger Statements:** Insert `debugger` statements in critical functions to pause execution and inspect variables in the browser’s DevTools.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Time-Travel Debugging**\n- **Redux DevTools:** If using Redux, the Redux DevTools extension allows you to inspect actions, state snapshots, and even “time travel” through state changes.\n- **MobX DevTools:** Similar tools exist for MobX and other state libraries.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Isolate State Logic**\n- **Custom Hooks:** Extract complex state logic into custom hooks. This makes it easier to test and debug in isolation.\n- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for your hooks, reducers, or state logic using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Check for Common Pitfalls**\n- **State Mutations:** Ensure you’re not mutating state directly, especially in reducers or when using `useState`.\n- **Stale Closures:** Watch out for closures capturing outdated state values in asynchronous callbacks or effects.\n- **Prop Drilling:** Excessive prop drilling can make state flow hard to track. Consider using context or state management libraries.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Analyze Performance**\n- **React Profiler:** Use the Profiler tab in React DevTools to measure component render times and identify unnecessary re-renders.\n- **Memoization:** Check if missing `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback` is causing excessive renders.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Visualize State Flow**\n- **State Diagrams:** Draw diagrams of your state structure and data flow to clarify relationships and dependencies.\n- **Flowcharts:** Use tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) or [Miro](https://miro.com/) for collaborative debugging sessions.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Collaborate and Review**\n- **Pair Programming:** Debug with a teammate to get a fresh perspective.\n- **Code Reviews:** Have others review your state management logic for potential issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Tool/Technique         | Use Case                                      |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| React DevTools         | Inspect component state/props                 |\n| Redux/MobX DevTools    | Time-travel and action/state inspection       |\n| Console/Debugger       | Trace and pause code execution                |\n| Custom Hooks/Testing   | Isolate and test state logic                  |\n| Profiler               | Analyze and optimize performance              |\n| Diagrams/Collaboration | Clarify and communicate complex flows         |\n\n---\n\n**Tip:** Always break down complex state into manageable pieces, and prefer predictable, testable state transitions (e.g., using reducers) for easier debugging.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools)\n- [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools)\n- [React Profiler](https://react.dev/reference/react/Profiler)",

        "answer": "```markdown ### Implications of Deeply Nested State Objects in React\n\nManaging deeply nested state objects in React can introduce several challenges and implications:\n\n#### 1. **Complex State Updates**\n- **Immutability:** React state should be updated immutably. Updating a deeply nested property requires copying each level of the object, which can be verbose and error-prone.\n- **Example:**\n  ```js\n  setState(prevState => ({\n    ...prevState,\n    user: {\n      ...prevState.user,\n      address: {\n        ...prevState.user.address,\n        city: 'New City'\n      }\n    }\n  }));\n  ```\n\n#### 2. **Performance Concerns**\n- **Unnecessary Re-renders:** Updating a nested property can cause the entire object (and possibly its parent components) to re-render, even if only a small part of the state changed.\n- **Shallow Comparison Limitations:** React’s `shouldComponentUpdate` and `React.memo` use shallow comparison, which may not detect changes deep within nested objects.\n\n#### 3. **Readability and Maintainability**\n- **Code Complexity:** The more deeply nested your state, the harder it is to read, understand, and maintain your code.\n- **Bug-Prone:** It’s easier to introduce bugs when copying and updating deeply nested structures.\n\n#### 4. **State Normalization**\n- **Best Practice:** It’s often recommended to normalize state (flatten it) to avoid deep nesting, similar to how data is structured in databases.\n- **Libraries:** Tools like [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) or using state management libraries (e.g., Redux) with normalized state can help.\n\n#### 5. **Alternative Solutions**\n- **Splitting State:** Use multiple `useState` or `useReducer` hooks to manage independent pieces of state.\n- **Context API:** For deeply shared state, React Context can help, but be cautious as it can also lead to unnecessary re-renders if not used carefully.\n- **State Management Libraries:** Libraries like Redux, Zustand, or MobX provide patterns and utilities for managing complex state structures more efficiently.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nDeeply nested state objects can lead to complex, less maintainable code, performance issues, and bugs. Prefer flattening state, using multiple state hooks, or leveraging state management libraries to handle complex state more effectively.",

        "question": "How can you use custom hooks to abstract state management logic?",
        "answer": "```markdown\n### Using Custom Hooks to Abstract State Management Logic in React\n\nCustom hooks in React allow you to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. By abstracting state management logic into custom hooks, you can:\n\n- **Separate concerns:** Keep state logic out of UI components.\n- **Promote reusability:** Share the same logic across multiple components.\n- **Improve testability:** Test state logic independently from UI.\n\n#### Example: Abstracting Form State Management\n\nSuppose you have a form with multiple fields. Instead of managing state in each component, you can create a custom hook:\n\n```jsx\n// useForm.js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction useForm(initialValues) {\n  const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    const { name, value } = e.target;\n    setValues((prev) => ({\n      ...prev,\n      [name]: value,\n    }));\n  };\n\n  const resetForm = () => setValues(initialValues);\n\n  return [values, handleChange, resetForm];\n}\n\nexport default useForm;\n```\n\n**Usage in a component:**\n\n```jsx\nimport useForm from './useForm';\n\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [values, handleChange, resetForm] = useForm({ username: '', password: '' });\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // handle login with values\n    resetForm();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input name=\"username\" value={values.username} onChange={handleChange} />\n      <input name=\"password\" value={values.password} onChange={handleChange} type=\"password\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- **Encapsulation:** The `useForm` hook encapsulates all form state logic.\n- **Reusability:** Any form can use `useForm` without duplicating logic.\n- **Decoupling:** UI components focus on rendering, not managing state.\n\n#### More Advanced Example: Global State with Context and Custom Hook\n\nYou can combine React Context with a custom hook for global state:\n\n```jsx\n// CounterContext.js\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';\n\nconst CounterContext = createContext();\n\nfunction counterReducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'decrement': return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default: throw new Error();\n  }\n}\n\nexport function CounterProvider({ children }) {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });\n  return (\n    <CounterContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>\n      {children}\n    </CounterContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function useCounter() {\n  return useContext(CounterContext);\n}\n```\n\nNow, any component can use `useCounter()` to access and modify the global counter state.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nCustom hooks are a powerful abstraction for state management logic in React. They enable you to write modular, reusable, and testable code by separating stateful logic from UI components.\n```\n",

        "question": "How do you test components that use complex state management?",
        "answer": "```markdown Testing React components with complex state management involves a combination of strategies and tools to ensure reliability and maintainability. Here’s how you can approach it:\n\n## 1. **Isolate State Logic**\n\n- **Custom Hooks:** If your state logic is encapsulated in custom hooks, test them separately using libraries like [`@testing-library/react-hooks`](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/).\n- **Redux/Context:** For Redux or Context, test reducers and actions independently.\n\n## 2. **Use the Right Testing Tools**\n\n- **Jest:** For unit testing logic, reducers, and actions.\n- **React Testing Library:** For integration and UI testing, focusing on user interactions and component outputs.\n- **Mocking:** Use tools like `jest.mock` to mock APIs or external dependencies.\n\n## 3. **Test at Multiple Levels**\n\n### a. **Unit Testing**\n\n- Test pure functions (reducers, selectors, custom hooks) in isolation.\n- Example (Redux reducer):\n\n  ```js\n  import reducer, { initialState } from './reducer';\n  test('should handle ADD_ITEM', () => {\n    const action = { type: 'ADD_ITEM', payload: 'apple' };\n    const state = reducer(initialState, action);\n    expect(state.items).toContain('apple');\n  });\n  ```\n\n### b. **Integration Testing**\n\n- Render the component with the state provider (Redux Provider, Context Provider).\n- Simulate user interactions and assert UI changes.\n\n  ```jsx\n  import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\n  import { Provider } from 'react-redux';\n  import store from './store';\n  import MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\n  test('adds item on button click', () => {\n    const { getByText, getByRole } = render(\n      <Provider store={store}>\n        <MyComponent />\n      </Provider>\n    );\n    fireEvent.click(getByText('Add Item'));\n    expect(getByRole('list')).toHaveTextContent('apple');\n  });\n  ```\n\n### c. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**\n\n- Use Cypress or Playwright to test the full application flow, ensuring state changes persist across components and routes.\n\n## 4. **Mock State When Needed**\n\n- For complex or asynchronous state, mock the store or context to simulate various scenarios (loading, error, success).\n\n  ```js\n  // Example with Redux mock store\n  import configureStore from 'redux-mock-store';\n  const mockStore = configureStore();\n  const store = mockStore({ items: ['apple'] });\n  ```\n\n## 5. **Assert on Output, Not Implementation**\n\n- Focus on what the user sees or can interact with, not internal state or implementation details.\n\n## 6. **Test Asynchronous State Changes**\n\n- Use `waitFor` or `findBy*` queries from React Testing Library to handle async updates.\n\n  ```js\n  import { waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\n  await waitFor(() => expect(getByText('Loaded')).toBeInTheDocument());\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Level           | What to Test                  | Tools/Libraries                |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Unit            | Reducers, hooks, actions      | Jest, react-hooks-testing-lib  |\n| Integration     | Components + state providers  | React Testing Library, Jest    |\n| End-to-End      | Full app flows                | Cypress, Playwright            |\n\n---\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Keep state logic testable and modular.\n- Prefer testing user behavior over implementation details.\n- Use mocks and providers to simulate complex state scenarios.\n\nBy combining these approaches, you can confidently test React components that rely on complex state management.",

        "answer": "```markdown Certainly! Here’s an answer in markdown format:\n\n---\n\n## Integrating State Management with TypeScript in React\n\nIntegrating state management with TypeScript in React enhances type safety and developer experience. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### 1. **Using useState with TypeScript**\n\nYou can specify the type of state directly:\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst Counter: React.FC = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n      Count: {count}\n    </button>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### 2. **Using useReducer with Typed Actions and State**\n\nDefine types for state and actions:\n\n```tsx\ntype State = { count: number };\ntype Action = { type: 'increment' } | { type: 'decrement' };\n\nfunction reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'increment':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'decrement':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\nconst Counter: React.FC = () => {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>\n      <span>{state.count}</span>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### 3. **Type-Safe Context API**\n\nDefine context value types:\n\n```tsx\ntype Theme = 'light' | 'dark';\n\ninterface ThemeContextType {\n  theme: Theme;\n  toggleTheme: () => void;\n}\n\nconst ThemeContext = React.createContext<ThemeContextType | undefined>(undefined);\n\nconst ThemeProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>('light');\n  const toggleTheme = () => setTheme(t => (t === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>\n      {children}\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### 4. **Using Third-Party Libraries (e.g., Redux Toolkit) with TypeScript**\n\nRedux Toolkit and other libraries have built-in TypeScript support. Define your state and actions with types, and use typed hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.\n\n```tsx\n// store.ts\ninterface CounterState {\n  value: number;\n}\n\nconst initialState: CounterState = { value: 0 };\n\n// slice, actions, and selectors use these types\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nTypeScript can be integrated with React state management by explicitly typing state, actions, and context values. This ensures type safety and better tooling support, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.",

        "answer": "```markdown Selectors play a crucial role in optimizing state access in React state management, especially when using libraries like Redux, Recoil, or Zustand. Their main functions include:\n\n### 1. Encapsulation of State Logic\nSelectors abstract the logic for retrieving and deriving data from the state. This keeps components decoupled from the structure of the state, making refactoring and maintenance easier.\n\n```js\n// Example: Redux selector\nconst selectVisibleTodos = (state) => state.todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);\n```\n\n### 2. Performance Optimization via Memoization\nSelectors can be memoized (e.g., using [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)), so they only recompute derived data when relevant parts of the state change. This prevents unnecessary recalculations and re-renders, improving performance.\n\n```js\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect';\n\nconst selectTodos = (state) => state.todos;\nconst selectFilter = (state) => state.filter;\n\nconst selectVisibleTodos = createSelector(\n  [selectTodos, selectFilter],\n  (todos, filter) => todos.filter(todo => todo.status === filter)\n);\n```\n\n### 3. Preventing Unnecessary Renders\nBy using selectors, components only subscribe to the specific slices of state they need. When the selected data doesn't change, the component doesn't re-render, even if other parts of the state update.\n\n### 4. Reusability and Testability\nSelectors can be reused across multiple components and are easy to test in isolation, leading to more maintainable and robust codebases.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nSelectors optimize state access by encapsulating state logic, enabling memoization for performance, minimizing unnecessary re-renders, and promoting reusability and testability.

        "answer": "```markdown\nMigrating from one state management solution to another in a large React codebase is a complex process that requires careful planning and incremental execution. Here’s a structured approach:\n\n## 1. **Assess the Current State Usage**\n- **Inventory**: Identify where and how the current state management (e.g., Redux, MobX, Context API) is used.\n- **Categorize**: Classify state into global, shared, and local state.\n\n## 2. **Plan the Migration**\n- **Choose Migration Strategy**:\n  - **Big Bang**: Replace everything at once (rarely recommended for large codebases).\n  - **Incremental/Strangler Fig**: Gradually migrate feature by feature or module by module.\n- **Compatibility Layer**: Consider creating adapters or bridges to allow both old and new state solutions to coexist temporarily.\n\n## 3. **Set Up the New State Management Solution**\n- **Install and Configure**: Add the new library (e.g., Zustand, Recoil, Redux Toolkit).\n- **Provider Setup**: Wrap your app with the new provider if necessary.\n\n## 4. **Migrate Feature by Feature**\n- **Select a Feature/Module**: Start with less critical or isolated features.\n- **Refactor State Usage**: Replace old state hooks/selectors/actions with the new solution.\n- **Bridge Data if Needed**: Use context or custom hooks to sync data between old and new stores during the transition.\n\n## 5. **Testing**\n- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Ensure migrated features work as expected.\n- **Regression Testing**: Verify that migration does not break unrelated parts of the app.\n\n## 6. **Iterate**\n- **Repeat**: Continue migrating features incrementally.\n- **Monitor Performance and Bugs**: Watch for regressions or performance issues.\n\n## 7. **Cleanup**\n- **Remove Old State Management**: Once all features are migrated, uninstall the old library and remove related code.\n- **Refactor**: Clean up any temporary bridges or compatibility layers.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Practices**\n- **Documentation**: Keep migration steps and patterns well-documented.\n- **Communication**: Coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts.\n- **Code Reviews**: Ensure thorough reviews for each migration step.\n- **Automated Tests**: Rely on a robust test suite to catch issues early.\n\n---\n\n### **Example: Redux to Zustand (Incremental)**\n1. Install Zustand and set up a store.\n2. For a selected feature, replace `useSelector`/`useDispatch` with Zustand hooks.\n3. If needed, sync data between Redux and Zustand during the transition.\n4. Gradually expand Zustand usage to more features.\n5. Remove Redux once migration is complete.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nMigrating state management in a large React codebase is best done incrementally, with careful planning, feature-by-feature migration, and strong testing to ensure stability throughout the process.\n```\n",
