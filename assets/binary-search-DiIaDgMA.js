Binary search requires the input array to be sorted because it works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, it compares the target value to the middle element of the current interval:

- If the target is equal to the middle element, the search is successful.
- If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half.
- If the target is greater, the search continues in the right half.

This process only works if the array is sorted, because the algorithm relies on the order of elements to decide which half to search next. If the array is not sorted, there is no guarantee that the target value will be in the correct half, and binary search will not work correctly.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820804Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"665c249e-9dfb-48ba-9697-2ee77be78b96",question:"How does binary search differ from linear search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Binary Search vs. Linear Search**

Binary search is more efficient than linear search but requires the list to be sorted. Linear search works on any list but is slower for large datasets.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820812Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"d77478e8-43b2-4917-9087-0f037d94fc25",question:"What is binary search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Binary search** is an efficient algorithm used to find a specific value in a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half:

1. Start with the entire sorted list.
2. Compare the target value to the middle element.
3. If the target is equal to the middle element, the search is successful.
4. If the target is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half.
5. If the target is greater, repeat the search on the right half.
6. Continue until the value is found or the interval is empty.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

**Example:**

Suppose you have the sorted array \`[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\` and want to find \`7\`:

- Middle element is \`5\` (index 2). \`7 > 5\`, so search right half.
- Next middle is \`9\` (index 4). \`7 < 9\`, so search left half.
- Now only \`7\` (index 3) remains. Found!

1. **Start with a sorted array/list.**
2. **Set two pointers:** one at the beginning (low) and one at the end (high) of the array.
3. **Find the middle element:**  
   Calculate the middle index:  
   \`mid = (low + high) // 2\`
4. **Compare the middle element with the target value:**
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is successful.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half (set high = mid - 1).
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half (set low = mid + 1).
5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4** until the target is found or the low pointer exceeds the high pointer (which means the target is not in the array).

**Example in Pseudocode:**
\`\`\`plaintext
function binarySearch(array, target):
    low = 0
    high = length(array) - 1

    while low <= high:

- Time complexity: O(log n)`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820820Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"2e7dc959-90cb-49fd-8590-b67144b141dc",question:"What happens if the target element is not present in the array during binary search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown If the target element is not present in the array during a binary search, the search algorithm will repeatedly divide the array and compare the target with the middle element. Eventually, the search interval will become empty (the left index will be greater than the right index). At this point, the algorithm concludes that the target is not in the array and typically returns a special value, such as -1 or None, to indicate that the search was unsuccessful.

**Example in Python:**

\`\`\`python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

Why or why not?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

Binary search is generally **not efficient** for linked lists. 

### Reason:

- **Binary search** requires **random access** to the middle element of the data structure in each iteration.
- In an **array**, accessing the middle element is an **O(1)** operation because arrays support direct indexing.
- In a **linked list**, to access the middle element, you must **traverse from the head node**, which takes **O(n)** time in the worst case.

### Consequence:

- Each step of binary search on a linked list would take linear time, making the overall time complexity **O(n log n)** instead of **O(log n)** as with arrays.
- This defeats the main advantage of binary search.

### Conclusion:

> **Binary search is not suitable for linked lists because they do not support efficient random access.**

**Note:**  
If you use a **doubly linked list** with additional pointers or an auxiliary array for indexing, you could simulate binary search, but this adds extra space and complexity.

### Example Code

**Iterative Implementation (Python):**
\`\`\`python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

**Recursive Implementation (Python):**
\`\`\`python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:

Binary search can efficiently approximate the square root of a non-negative number \\( x \\), especially when you want a result with a certain precision (e.g., up to 6 decimal places).

#### Steps:

1. **Define the Search Range:**
   - If \\( x \\geq 1 \\), set \`low = 0\` and \`high = x\`.
   - If \\( 0 < x < 1 \\), set \`low = 0\` and \`high = 1\`.

2. **Iterative Binary Search:**
   - While the difference between \`high\` and \`low\` is greater than your desired precision (e.g., \\( 10^{-6} \\)):
     - Compute \`mid = (low + high) / 2\`.
     - If \\( mid^2 < x \\), set \`low = mid\`.
     - If \\( mid^2 > x \\), set \`high = mid\`.
     - If \\( mid^2 \\) is close enough to \\( x \\) (within the precision), return \`mid\`.

3. **Return the Approximation:**
   - After the loop, \`low\` (or \`high\`) will be very close to the actual square root.

#### Example in Python

\`\`\`python
def sqrt_binary_search(x, precision=1e-6):
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute square root of negative number.")
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return x
    low, high = (0, x) if x >= 1 else (0, 1)
    while high - low > precision:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if mid * mid < x:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    return (low + high) / 2

# Example usage:
print(sqrt_binary_search(9))      # Output: ~3.0
print(sqrt_binary_search(0.25))   # Output: ~0.5
\`\`\`

#### Key Points

- Binary search narrows down the possible values for the square root by repeatedly halving the interval.
- This method works for both perfect squares and non-perfect squares, and for numbers less than 1.
- The precision can be adjusted according to requirements.

**Summary:**  
Binary search is a powerful tool for finding the square root of a number by treating the problem as searching for a value \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 \\approx x \\) within a specified precision.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820906Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"067c7e94-8cb3-4b6f-9e47-c876af26b3a4",question:"How would you modify binary search to find the first occurrence of a target value in a sorted array with duplicates?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To find the **first occurrence** of a target value in a sorted array with duplicates using binary search, you need to modify the standard algorithm so that it continues searching to the left even after finding the target. Here’s how you can do it:

### Steps

1. Initialize \`left = 0\`, \`right = n - 1\`, and \`result = -1\`.
2. While \`left <= right\`:
    - Compute \`mid = left + (right - left) // 2\`.
    - If \`arr[mid] == target\`:
        - Set \`result = mid\` (potential first occurrence).
        - Move \`right = mid - 1\` to continue searching left.
    - Else if \`arr[mid] < target\`:
        - Move \`left = mid + 1\`.
    - Else:
        - Move \`right = mid - 1\`.
3. After the loop, \`result\` holds the index of the first occurrence (or \`-1\` if not found).

### Python Example

\`\`\`python
def first_occurrence(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1  # Keep searching to the left
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result
\`\`\`

### Key Modification

- **After finding the target, move the right pointer leftward (\`right = mid - 1\`) instead of returning immediately.** This ensures you find the leftmost (first) occurrence.

Here’s a comparison:

### Time Complexity

- **Linear Search:**  
  - Checks each element one by one.
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Binary Search:**  
  - Repeatedly divides the sorted dataset in half.
  - **Time Complexity:** O(log n)

### Performance on Large Datasets

- **Linear Search:**  
  - As the dataset grows, the number of comparisons increases linearly.
  - For a dataset with 1,000,000 elements, it may require up to 1,000,000 comparisons in the worst case.
- **Binary Search:**  
  - The number of comparisons increases logarithmically.
  - For a dataset with 1,000,000 elements, it only needs about 20 comparisons (since log₂1,000,000 ≈ 20).

### Requirements

- **Binary search** requires the dataset to be **sorted**.
- **Linear search** works on both sorted and unsorted datasets.

### Summary Table

| Search Type     | Time Complexity | Sorted Data Required | Comparisons for 1,000,000 Elements |

   Start at the first element. Check the element at index 1, then at index 2, then 4, 8, 16, and so on (i.e., indices at powers of two: 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ...), doubling the index each time, until you find an index where the element is greater than or equal to the target, or you exceed the array bounds.

2. **Binary Search**:  
   Once the range \`[2^{k-1}, 2^k]\` is found such that the target lies within this range, perform a standard binary search within this subarray.

### Relationship to Binary Search

- **Exponential search uses binary search as a subroutine.**  
  The exponential phase quickly narrows down the possible range where the target could be, and then binary search is used to efficiently find the exact index within that range.

- **Efficiency**:  
  - The exponential phase takes O(log i) time, where i is the index of the target.
  - The binary search phase also takes O(log i) time within the found range.
  - **Total time complexity:** O(log i), which is very efficient for large or unbounded arrays.

### Use Cases

- Searching in unbounded or infinite-sized arrays (e.g., data streams, linked lists with unknown length).
- Situations where the size of the array is very large and a traditional binary search would require knowing the array length in advance.

### Example

\`\`\`python
def exponential_search(arr, target):
    if arr[0] == target:
        return 0
    index = 1
    while index < len(arr) and arr[index] <= target:
        index *= 2
    # Binary search between index/2 and min(index, len(arr)-1)
    left, right = index // 2, min(index, len(arr)-1)
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
\`\`\`

### Summary Table

| Step                | Algorithm Used   | Time Complexity |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Range Finding       | Exponential     | O(log i)        |

| **Total**           |                 | **O(log i)**    |

**In summary:**  
Exponential search is a hybrid algorithm that uses exponential steps to find a search range and then applies binary search within that range. It is particularly useful for searching in large or unbounded sorted arrays, leveraging binary search for efficient lookup after quickly narrowing down the search interval.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820898Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"d99b0714-0a06-46f7-a854-4917167028a1",question:"How does binary search work on a descending sorted array?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown ### How Binary Search Works on a Descending Sorted Array

Binary search is a fast algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. When the array is **sorted in descending order** (from largest to smallest), the logic of binary search must be slightly adjusted compared to the standard (ascending order) case.

#### Steps for Binary Search on a Descending Array

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Set \`low = 0\` and \`high = n - 1\`, where \`n\` is the length of the array.

2. **Iterate:**
   - While \`low <= high\`:
     - Calculate \`mid = low + (high - low) // 2\`.
     - Compare the target value (\`x\`) with \`arr[mid]\`:
       - **If \`arr[mid] == x\`:** Return \`mid\` (element found).
       - **If \`arr[mid] < x\`:** Search the **left half** by setting \`high = mid - 1\`.
       - **If \`arr[mid] > x\`:** Search the **right half** by setting \`low = mid + 1\`.

#### Why the Comparison is Reversed

- In a **descending array**, larger values are at lower indices.
- If the middle value is **less than** the target, the target must be **to the left**.
- If the middle value is **greater than** the target, the target must be **to the right**.

#### Example

Suppose \`arr = [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]\` and you want to find \`5\`:

| low | high | mid | arr[mid] | Compare to 5 | Next step      |
|-----|------|-----|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 0   | 4    | 2   | 5        | ==           | Found at 2    |

#### Pseudocode

\`\`\`python
def binary_search_desc(arr, x):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return -1
\`\`\`

---

**Summary:**  
Binary search on a descending sorted array works similarly to the standard version, but the direction of search after each comparison is reversed. Always compare carefully and adjust the \`low\` and \`high\` pointers accordingly.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820949Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"68d002ee-0813-44a6-a949-8ce02d3ba84d",question:"What are the potential pitfalls when implementing binary search recursively?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Potential Pitfalls When Implementing Binary Search Recursively**

1. **Stack Overflow (Excessive Recursion Depth):**
   - Recursive binary search can cause a stack overflow if the input array is very large, as each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.

2. **Incorrect Base Case:**
   - Failing to define the correct base case (e.g., \`low > high\`) can lead to infinite recursion or missing the termination condition.

3. **Integer Overflow in Mid Calculation:**
   - Calculating the middle index as \`mid = (low + high) / 2\` can cause integer overflow for large values. The safer way is:
     \`\`\`python
     mid = low + (high - low) // 2
     \`\`\`

4. **Not Returning the Result Properly:**
   - Forgetting to return the result of the recursive call can lead to incorrect results or always returning a default value.

5. **Off-by-One Errors:**
   - Mistakes in updating the \`low\` and \`high\` pointers (e.g., using \`mid\` instead of \`mid + 1\` or \`mid - 1\`) can cause infinite loops or skip potential matches.

6. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - If the array contains duplicates and you need to find the first or last occurrence, additional logic is required; the standard recursive approach may not suffice.

---

**Example of Safe Recursive Binary Search in Python:**

\`\`\`python
def binary_search(arr, low, high, target):
    if low > high:
        return -1
    mid = low + (high - low) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, target)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, target)
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
When implementing recursive binary search, be careful with base cases, mid calculation, stack depth, and pointer updates to avoid common pitfalls.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820913Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"236f3a30-4f32-49c6-963a-f40b5dbfb04c",question:"How do you handle binary search on a rotated sorted array?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To perform binary search on a rotated sorted array, you need to modify the standard binary search to account for the rotation. The key insight is that, even after rotation, at least one half of the array (left or right) will always be sorted. Here’s how you can handle it:

### Steps

1. **Initialize Pointers:**  
   Set \`left = 0\` and \`right = n - 1\`.

2. **Iterate with Binary Search:**
   - While \`left <= right\`:
     - Compute \`mid = left + (right - left) // 2\`.
     - If \`arr[mid] == target\`, return \`mid\`.
     - Determine which half is sorted:
       - **Left half is sorted:** If \`arr[left] <= arr[mid]\`
         - If \`arr[left] <= target < arr[mid]\`, search left: \`right = mid - 1\`
         - Else, search right: \`left = mid + 1\`
       - **Right half is sorted:** Else
         - If \`arr[mid] < target <= arr[right]\`, search right: \`left = mid + 1\`
         - Else, search left: \`right = mid - 1\`

3. **Not Found:**  
   If the loop ends, the target is not in the array.

### Example Code (Python)

\`\`\`python
def search_rotated_array(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # Left half is sorted
        if arr[left] <= arr[mid]:
            if arr[left] <= target < arr[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # Right half is sorted
        else:
            if arr[mid] < target <= arr[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return -1
\`\`\`

### Key Points

- Always check which half is sorted.
- Narrow the search to the half where the target could possibly exist.
- Time complexity remains **O(log n)**.

What are the challenges?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Yes, binary search can be used on data stored in external memory (such as files on disk), but there are significant challenges and considerations:

### Challenges

1. **Random Access Requirement**  
   Binary search relies on the ability to access the middle element of the data efficiently. In RAM, this is trivial with arrays, but in external memory (like files), random access can be much slower, especially if the file is very large or stored on a medium with high seek times (e.g., traditional hard drives).

2. **I/O Overhead**  
   Each access to a random position in a file may require a disk seek, which is orders of magnitude slower than accessing data in RAM. Binary search on a file will thus incur significant I/O overhead, especially for large files.

3. **Data Organization**  
   The data must be stored in a format that supports efficient random access. For example, fixed-length records allow easy calculation of the byte offset for any record, but variable-length records complicate this process.

4. **Buffering and Caching**  
   Operating systems and file systems use buffering and caching to speed up file access, but these mechanisms may not always align well with the access patterns of binary search, potentially leading to cache misses and more disk reads.

5. **Concurrency and Consistency**  
   If the file is being modified concurrently (by other processes or threads), maintaining consistency during a binary search can be challenging.

### Practical Solutions

- **Fixed-Size Records**: Store data in fixed-size records to allow direct computation of the offset for any record.
- **Indexing**: Use auxiliary index structures (like B-trees) to reduce the number of disk accesses needed for search operations.
- **Memory Mapping**: Use memory-mapped files to let the operating system handle paging, though this still doesn't eliminate the fundamental I/O bottleneck.
- **Batch Reads**: Read larger blocks of data into memory at once to minimize the number of disk accesses.

### Summary Table

| Challenge                | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Random Access            | Slow and costly on disk compared to RAM                                     |
| I/O Overhead             | Each search step may require a disk seek                                    |
| Data Organization        | Fixed-size records are preferable for easy offset calculation               |
| Buffering/Caching        | May not align with binary search access patterns                            |
| Concurrency/Consistency  | File changes during search can cause inconsistencies                        |

**In conclusion:**  
Binary search is possible on external memory, but its efficiency is limited by the high cost of random access and I/O operations. Specialized data structures (like B-trees) are often preferred for searching large datasets stored on disk.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820927Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"affb6525-8d91-4d5d-bbc3-e92336f06f23",question:"How would you use binary search to find the insertion position for a new element in a sorted array?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To find the insertion position for a new element in a sorted array using binary search, you want to find the index where the new element can be inserted while maintaining the array's sorted order. This is often called finding the "lower bound" or the "first position not less than the target".

Here's how you can do it:

### Steps

1. **Initialize pointers:**
   - Set \`left = 0\` and \`right = length of array\`.

2. **Binary search loop:**
   - While \`left < right\`:
     - Compute \`mid = left + (right - left) // 2\`.
     - If \`array[mid] < target\`, set \`left = mid + 1\`.
     - Else, set \`right = mid\`.

3. **Result:**
   - After the loop, \`left\` is the index where you can insert the new element.

### Example in Python

\`\`\`python
def find_insertion_position(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr)
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

### Example Usage

\`\`\`python
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7]
target = 4
pos = find_insertion_position(arr, target)
print(pos)  # Output: 2
\`\`\`
You can insert \`4\` at index \`2\` to keep the array sorted: \`[1, 3, 4, 5, 7]\`.

Binary search can efficiently find the correct insertion position for a new element in a sorted array in O(log n) time.

#### **Ternary Search**

Ternary search is a divide-and-conquer search algorithm used to find the maximum or minimum of a unimodal function (a function that increases then decreases, or vice versa) or to search for an element in a sorted array. Instead of dividing the search space into two parts like binary search, ternary search divides it into three parts.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Given a sorted array or unimodal function within a range \`[l, r]\`.
2. Compute two midpoints:  
   - \`mid1 = l + (r - l) / 3\`
   - \`mid2 = r - (r - l) / 3\`
3. Compare the target value (or function value) at \`mid1\` and \`mid2\`.
4. Based on the comparison, eliminate one-third of the search space.
5. Repeat the process on the remaining two-thirds.

#### **Binary Search**

Binary search divides the search space into two halves at each step and eliminates one half based on the comparison with the middle element.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Given a sorted array within a range \`[l, r]\`.
2. Compute the midpoint:  
   - \`mid = l + (r - l) / 2\`
3. Compare the target value with the element at \`mid\`.
4. Eliminate half of the search space.
5. Repeat the process on the remaining half.

| Use Case          | Sorted arrays, monotonic functions   | Unimodal functions, sorted arrays     |
| Practical Speed   | Usually faster due to fewer comparisons | Slightly slower in practice for arrays |

- **Efficiency:**  
  Although ternary search reduces the search space by a factor of 1/3 each time (vs. 1/2 for binary search), it requires two comparisons per iteration instead of one. In practice, binary search is generally more efficient for searching in sorted arrays.

- **When to Use Ternary Search:**  
  Ternary search is particularly useful for finding the maximum or minimum of a unimodal function, where binary search is not directly applicable.

Binary search is not limited to searching for elements in a sorted array—it can also be a powerful tool for solving optimization problems, especially those that involve finding the minimum or maximum value that satisfies certain conditions.

#### **Key Idea**

If you can reframe the optimization problem as a decision problem—i.e., "Is it possible to achieve a value \`x\`?"—and the answer to this question is **monotonic** (if it's possible for \`x\`, it's also possible for all values greater/less than \`x\`), then binary search can efficiently find the optimal value.

#### **General Steps**

1. **Define the Search Space:**  
   Identify the range of possible answers (e.g., minimum and maximum possible values).

2. **Decision Function:**  
   Implement a function that, given a candidate value, returns \`true\` if the condition is satisfied and \`false\` otherwise.

3. **Binary Search:**  
   Use binary search over the search space, using the decision function to guide the search towards the optimal value.

#### **Example: Minimum Maximum Distance**

Suppose you have to place \`k\` routers in \`n\` houses (positions sorted), and you want to maximize the minimum distance between any two routers. The problem can be reframed:

- **Search Space:** The minimum distance can range from \`1\` to the distance between the farthest houses.
- **Decision Function:** For a given distance \`d\`, can we place all \`k\` routers such that each is at least \`d\` apart?
- **Binary Search:** Find the largest \`d\` for which the answer is \`true\`.

#### **Pseudocode**

\`\`\`python
def is_possible(distance):
    # Implement logic to check if routers can be placed with at least 'distance' apart
    pass

left, right = 1, max_possible_distance
answer = 0

while left <= right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if is_possible(mid):
        answer = mid
        left = mid + 1  # Try for a larger distance
    else:
        right = mid - 1  # Try for a smaller distance

return answer
\`\`\`

#### **Other Applications**

- **Minimizing the maximum workload (job scheduling)**
- **Finding the smallest/largest feasible value in resource allocation**
- **Optimal cutting of materials (e.g., wood, cable)**
- **Threshold problems (e.g., minimum speed to arrive on time)**

#### **Summary Table**

| Problem Type                | Binary Search On      | Decision Function Checks             |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Maximize minimum distance   | Distance             | Feasibility of placement             |
| Minimize maximum workload   | Workload             | If jobs can be assigned within limit |
| Minimize largest piece size | Piece size           | If cuts can be made within limit     |

**In summary:**  
Binary search can efficiently solve optimization problems by searching over the answer space, provided the feasibility condition is monotonic. This approach is often called "binary search on the answer."`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820963Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"d75872dd-f65c-4f14-a559-0a8635c04deb",question:"What is the difference between lower_bound and upper_bound in binary search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

In binary search, particularly in the context of sorted arrays or containers (like in C++ STL), \`lower_bound\` and \`upper_bound\` are two useful operations:

### \`lower_bound\`
- **Definition:** Finds the first position in the sorted array where the given value could be inserted without violating the order (i.e., the first element that is **not less than** the target value).
- **Returns:** Iterator (or index) to the first element **greater than or equal to** the target value.

### \`upper_bound\`
- **Definition:** Finds the first position in the sorted array where the given value could be inserted **after** all occurrences of that value (i.e., the first element that is **greater than** the target value).
- **Returns:** Iterator (or index) to the first element **strictly greater than** the target value.

---

### Example

Suppose we have the sorted array:

\`\`\`cpp
std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 7};
\`\`\`

Let's search for the value \`4\`:

- \`lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 4)\` points to the **first 4** (index 2).
- \`upper_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 4)\` points to the **first 5** (index 4).

---

### Summary Table

| Function      | Returns position of...                  | For value \`4\` in \`[1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 7]\` |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| lower_bound   | First element **≥ target**             | Index 2 (first 4)                      |
| upper_bound   | First element **> target**              | Index 4 (first 5)                      |

---

When performing binary search on an empty array, the search will immediately determine that the target value is not present. This is because the search range is invalid from the start—there are no elements to examine.

In most implementations, the algorithm checks if the left index is greater than the right index (e.g., left > right). For an empty array, left is usually 0 and right is -1, so the condition is true right away. Therefore, binary search returns a "not found" result (often -1 or False), indicating the target does not exist in the array.

**Summary:**  
Binary search on an empty array always returns "not found" because there are no elements to search.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.820991Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"bbd8cf7d-1605-4826-b76e-54c1fca4f6c9",question:"What is interpolation search and how does it differ from binary search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Interpolation Search vs. Binary Search**

**Interpolation Search** is an improved variant of binary search for instances where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. Instead of always choosing the middle element, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value using a mathematical formula based on the value being searched and the values at the bounds.

### How Interpolation Search Works

Given a sorted array \`arr\` with indices \`low\` and \`high\`, and a target value \`x\`, the estimated position \`pos\` is calculated as:

\`\`\`text
pos = low + ((x - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low])
\`\`\`

- If \`arr[pos] == x\`, the search is successful.
- If \`arr[pos] < x\`, search continues in the subarray after \`pos\`.
- If \`arr[pos] > x\`, search continues in the subarray before \`pos\`.

### Difference from Binary Search

| Feature                | Binary Search                                      | Interpolation Search                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pivot Selection**    | Always the middle element                         | Estimated position based on value distribution       |
| **Assumption**         | Works on any sorted array                         | Works best on uniformly distributed sorted arrays    |
| **Time Complexity**    | O(log n)                                          | O(log log n) (best case, uniform distribution)       |
| **Worst Case**         | O(log n)                                          | O(n) (if distribution is highly skewed)              |
| **Use Case**           | General-purpose, robust                           | Optimized for uniform data, faster in best case      |

### Example

Suppose you search for \`42\` in \`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]\`:

- **Binary Search** checks the middle (50), then left (30, 40), then finds 40, then 42 is not found.
- **Interpolation Search** estimates that 42 is closer to 40 and 50, so it directly checks near that region, potentially reducing the number of probes.

### Summary

- **Binary search** divides the search space in half each time, regardless of the data distribution.
- **Interpolation search** uses the value of the target and the distribution of the array to estimate where to search, potentially reducing the number of comparisons for uniformly distributed data.

To perform binary search on a 2D matrix, the matrix must have certain properties. The most common scenario is:

- Each row is sorted in ascending order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

This allows us to treat the 2D matrix as a flattened 1D sorted array.

#### Steps:

1. **Flatten the Matrix Conceptually:**  
   For a matrix with \`m\` rows and \`n\` columns, the element at position \`(i, j)\` maps to index \`i * n + j\` in a virtual 1D array.

2. **Apply Binary Search:**  
   Use standard binary search with \`left = 0\` and \`right = m * n - 1\`.  
   For each \`mid\`, convert it back to 2D indices:  
   - \`row = mid // n\`
   - \`col = mid % n\`

3. **Compare and Adjust:**  
   Compare the matrix element at \`(row, col)\` with the target and adjust the search range accordingly.

#### Example Code (Python):

\`\`\`python
def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    left, right = 0, m * n - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        row, col = divmod(mid, n)
        mid_value = matrix[row][col]
        if mid_value == target:
            return True
        elif mid_value < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return False
\`\`\`

#### Time Complexity

- **O(log(m * n))**, where \`m\` is the number of rows and \`n\` is the number of columns.

#### Notes

- If the matrix does **not** have the above properties (e.g., only each row is sorted), a different approach is needed (such as starting from the top-right or bottom-left corner).
- Always check matrix boundaries to avoid index errors.

**Summary:**  
By treating the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array, you can efficiently apply binary search to find a target value in logarithmic time.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.821005Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"dbfe3385-ef11-432a-8fc4-6cb86acad06f",question:"Can binary search be parallelized? If so, how?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Yes, binary search can be parallelized, but its potential for parallelization is limited due to its inherently sequential nature. However, there are scenarios and techniques where parallelism can be applied:

### 1. Parallel Binary Search on Multiple Queries

If you have multiple search queries to perform on the same sorted array, you can execute each binary search independently and in parallel. This is known as **embarrassingly parallel** work, as each search does not depend on the others.

\`\`\`python
# Pseudocode for parallel binary search on multiple queries
parallel_for each query in queries:
    result[query] = binary_search(array, query)
\`\`\`

### 2. Parallelization Within a Single Binary Search

The classic binary search algorithm is sequential, as each iteration depends on the result of the previous comparison. However, some parallelization is possible in special cases:

- **Parallel Comparison:** In each iteration, you could compare the target value with multiple elements (e.g., the middle, quarter, and three-quarter points) to reduce the search space more aggressively. This is sometimes called **k-ary search** or **fractional cascading**. However, the overhead of extra comparisons and synchronization often outweighs the benefits for typical binary search use cases.

- **Parallel Search in Distributed Systems:** If the data is distributed across multiple machines (e.g., in a distributed database), you can perform binary search in parallel on different partitions, then combine the results.

### 3. Parallel Binary Search for Range Queries

In some advanced algorithms (e.g., in competitive programming), **parallel binary search** refers to a technique where you process multiple range queries in parallel by dividing the search space and resolving queries concurrently.

### 4. GPU and SIMD Implementations

On GPUs or with SIMD instructions, you can perform binary search on multiple data elements in parallel, which is useful for batch processing or searching in multiple arrays simultaneously.

Here’s how you can approach it:

## 1. Check Loop Conditions

- **Off-by-one errors**: Ensure your loop condition is correct. For example, use \`while (left <= right)\` instead of \`while (left < right)\` if you want to include both endpoints.
- **Infinite loops**: Make sure the pointers (\`left\`, \`right\`, or \`mid\`) are updated correctly to avoid infinite loops.

## 2. Calculate Midpoint Carefully

- **Integer overflow**: Instead of \`(left + right) / 2\`, use \`left + (right - left) / 2\` to prevent overflow in languages with fixed integer sizes.
- **Correct update**: After checking \`mid\`, update \`left\` or \`right\` correctly:
  - If searching for a value:  
    - If \`arr[mid] < target\`, set \`left = mid + 1\`
    - If \`arr[mid] > target\`, set \`right = mid - 1\`

## 3. Test Edge Cases

- **Empty array**: What happens if the input array is empty?
- **Single-element array**: Does your code handle arrays with only one element?
- **Target not present**: Does your code return the correct result if the target is not in the array?
- **Duplicates**: If the array contains duplicates, does your code find the correct occurrence (first/last)?

## 4. Use Print Statements or Debugger

- Print the values of \`left\`, \`right\`, and \`mid\` at each iteration to trace the algorithm’s progress.
- Use a debugger to step through the code and inspect variable values.

## 5. Compare with a Linear Search

- For small arrays, compare the result of your binary search with a simple linear search to verify correctness.

## 6. Review Return Values

- Ensure your function returns the correct index or indicator when the target is found or not found.

**Example Debugging Print Statement (Python):**
\`\`\`python
while left <= right:
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    print(f"left: {left}, right: {right}, mid: {mid}, arr[mid]: {arr[mid]}")
    # ... rest of the code

- **Efficiency:** Binary search is much faster than linear search for large, sorted datasets. It has a time complexity of O(log n), meaning it reduces the search space by half with each step.

- **Simplicity:** The algorithm is straightforward to implement, especially recursively.

**Disadvantages of Binary Search**

- **Requires Sorted Data:** Binary search only works on sorted arrays or lists. If the data is unsorted, it must be sorted first, which can add extra overhead.
- **Not Suitable for Linked Lists:** Binary search is inefficient on linked lists because accessing the middle element is not a constant-time operation.
- **Insertion/Deletion Overhead:** Maintaining a sorted array for binary search can be costly if there are frequent insertions or deletions.

This is because binary search stops as soon as it finds any index where arr[mid] == target.

If you need to find the first or last occurrence of a duplicate element, you can modify the binary search:

- **First occurrence:** After finding arr[mid] == target, continue searching the left half (set high = mid - 1) to check if the target appears earlier.
- **Last occurrence:** After finding arr[mid] == target, continue searching the right half (set low = mid + 1) to check if the target appears later.

**Example:**

\`\`\`python
# Find first occurrence of target in a sorted array with duplicates

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array, with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\). However, its real-world performance is also influenced by how well it utilizes the CPU cache, known as **cache locality**.

### 1. **Cache Locality Explained**
- **Spatial locality**: Accessing memory locations that are close together.
- **Temporal locality**: Accessing the same memory location repeatedly within a short period.

### 2. **Binary Search and Cache Locality**
- Binary search repeatedly divides the array and jumps to the middle of the current subarray.
- These jumps are often non-sequential and can be far apart in memory, especially in large arrays.

### 3. **Performance Implications**
- **Poor spatial locality**: Since binary search does not access consecutive elements, it often fails to take advantage of spatial locality. Each access may load a new cache line, causing frequent cache misses.
- **Cache misses**: When the required element is not in the cache, the CPU must fetch it from main memory, which is much slower.
- **Small arrays**: If the array fits entirely within the CPU cache, binary search is very fast.
- **Large arrays**: As the array size grows beyond the cache size, the number of cache misses increases, and the performance benefit of \\(O(\\log n)\\) time complexity is reduced.

### 4. **Optimizations**
- **Cache-aware algorithms**: Techniques like **Eytzinger layout** or **B-tree structures** can improve cache locality by organizing data to maximize cache line utilization.
- **Block search**: Dividing the array into blocks that fit into cache lines can help improve performance.

### 5. **Summary Table**

| Array Size         | Cache Locality | Binary Search Performance |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Fits in cache      | Good          | Very fast                |
| Exceeds cache size | Poor          | Slower due to cache misses|

### **Conclusion**

In a standard binary search, we require the array's bounds (start and end indices). However, for **infinite or unbounded arrays** (where the size is unknown or conceptually infinite), we need to adapt our approach.

#### Key Idea

Since we can't access the end of the array, we first need to find a range \`[low, high]\` such that the target element (or the position where it would be) lies within this range. Once this range is identified, we can perform a standard binary search within it.

#### Steps

1. **Find the Search Boundaries:**
   - Start with a small range, e.g., \`low = 0\`, \`high = 1\`.
   - While \`arr[high] < target\`:
     - Move \`low\` to \`high\`.
     - Double \`high\` (i.e., \`high = high * 2\`).
   - This exponentially increases the search window until the target is less than or equal to \`arr[high]\`.

2. **Apply Binary Search:**
   - Now, perform a standard binary search between \`low\` and \`high\`.

#### Pseudocode

\`\`\`python
def binary_search_infinite(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, 1
    # Find the proper bounds
    while arr[high] < target:
        low = high
        high = high * 2

    # Standard binary search
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
\`\`\`

#### Notes

- For truly infinite arrays, you would need a special data structure or API to access elements at any index.
- In practice, this approach is used for **unbounded sorted arrays** or **streams** where the size is not known in advance.
- The doubling step ensures that the number of accesses to find the boundary is \`O(log p)\`, where \`p\` is the position of the target, making the overall time complexity \`O(log p)\`.

#### Applications

- Searching in large files or data streams.
- Searching in linked lists or other data structures where size is unknown.

**Summary:**  
Binary search can be adapted to infinite or unbounded arrays by first finding a suitable search range using exponential expansion, then applying standard binary search within that range. This allows efficient searching even when array bounds are not known.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.821053Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"042db90a-22c6-46d0-8a99-37d25e733751",question:"What is the iterative approach to binary search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Iterative Approach to Binary Search**

The iterative approach to binary search involves using a loop to repeatedly divide the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty. Here’s how it works:

### Steps

1. **Initialize** two pointers: \`low\` (start of the array) and \`high\` (end of the array).
2. **While** \`low\` is less than or equal to \`high\`:
    - Calculate the middle index: \`mid = (low + high) // 2\`
    - If the target value equals \`arr[mid]\`, return \`mid\` (target found).
    - If the target value is less than \`arr[mid]\`, set \`high = mid - 1\` (search left half).
    - If the target value is greater than \`arr[mid]\`, set \`low = mid + 1\` (search right half).
3. If the loop ends without finding the target, return \`-1\` (target not found).

### Example Code (Python)

\`\`\`python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1
\`\`\`

### Key Points

- Works only on **sorted arrays**.
- Time complexity: **O(log n)**
- Uses a loop instead of recursion.

The iterative approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.821059Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"ecd26393-27ca-4c38-8b02-df9b484fdcf8",question:"What is the recursive approach to binary search?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Recursive Approach to Binary Search**

The recursive approach to binary search involves repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and calling the function recursively on the appropriate half. Here’s how it works:

1. **Base Case:** If the range is invalid (start > end), the element is not found.
2. **Find Middle:** Calculate the middle index of the current range.
3. **Compare:** 
    - If the middle element is the target, return its index.
    - If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half.
    - If the target is greater, search the right half.
4. **Recursive Call:** Call the function recursively with the new range.

**Example in Python:**

\`\`\`python
def binary_search(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Not found
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] > target:
        return binary_search(arr, target, left, mid - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, right)
\`\`\`

**Usage:**

\`\`\`python
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
target = 7
result = binary_search(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print(result)  # Output: 3

The most common cause of infinite loops is improper updating of these pointers, especially when calculating the middle index or when the search space is not reduced.

Here are key points to prevent infinite loops:

1. **Correct Middle Calculation**  
   Use \`mid = low + (high - low) // 2\` instead of \`(low + high) // 2\` to avoid potential integer overflow.

2. **Properly Update Boundaries**  
   - If the target is less than the middle element, move the upper boundary: \`high = mid - 1\`
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, move the lower boundary: \`low = mid + 1\`
   - If the target is found, return immediately.

3. **Loop Condition**  
   Use \`while low <= high:\` to ensure the search space is valid.

4. **No Stagnant Pointers**  
   Make sure that in each iteration, either \`low\` increases or \`high\` decreases, so the search space shrinks.

**Example in Python:**
\`\`\`python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1

2. **Element not found:**  
   If the search range becomes invalid (i.e., the left index is greater than the right index), the target value is not present in the array. Return a special value (commonly -1) to indicate failure.

Here’s an answer in markdown format:

---

## Using Binary Search to Find the Smallest/Largest Element Greater/Less Than a Target

Binary search can be adapted to efficiently find:

- The **smallest element greater than a target** (also called the "upper bound" or "successor")
- The **largest element less than a target** (also called the "lower bound" or "predecessor")

Assume you have a sorted array \`arr\` of length \`n\`.

### 1. Smallest Element Greater Than Target (Upper Bound)

**Goal:** Find the index of the smallest element \`> target\`.

**Approach:**
- Initialize \`left = 0\`, \`right = n - 1\`, \`answer = -1\`.
- While \`left <= right\`:
    - Compute \`mid = left + (right - left) // 2\`.
    - If \`arr[mid] > target\`:
        - Set \`answer = mid\` (potential answer).
        - Move \`right = mid - 1\` (look for a smaller valid value).
    - Else:
        - Move \`left = mid + 1\`.
- After the loop, \`answer\` holds the index, or \`-1\` if not found.

**Example Code (Python):**
\`\`\`python
def upper_bound(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    answer = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] > target:
            answer = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return answer
\`\`\`

### 2. Largest Element Less Than Target (Lower Bound)

**Goal:** Find the index of the largest element \`< target\`.

**Approach:**
- Initialize \`left = 0\`, \`right = n - 1\`, \`answer = -1\`.
- While \`left <= right\`:
    - Compute \`mid = left + (right - left) // 2\`.
    - If \`arr[mid] < target\`:
        - Set \`answer = mid\` (potential answer).
        - Move \`left = mid + 1\` (look for a larger valid value).
    - Else:
        - Move \`right = mid - 1\`.
- After the loop, \`answer\` holds the index, or \`-1\` if not found.

**Example Code (Python):**
\`\`\`python
def lower_bound(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    answer = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            answer = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return answer
\`\`\`

| Task                                    | What to Find         | Condition in Binary Search      |

| Smallest element > target (upper bound)  | arr[mid] > target    | Move right, keep answer         |
| Largest element < target (lower bound)   | arr[mid] < target    | Move left, keep answer          |

- **Efficiency:** Binary search still works correctly and quickly on small arrays, finding the target in at most log₂(n) steps (where n is the array size).
- **Overhead:** For very small arrays (e.g., 5–10 elements), the setup and logic of binary search may introduce a bit more overhead compared to a simple linear search, which just checks each element in order.
- **Practical Use:** In practice, for small arrays, linear search can be just as fast or even faster due to lower overhead and better use of CPU caches.

1. **Requires Sorted Data**  
   Binary search only works on sorted arrays or lists. If the data is not sorted, the algorithm will not function correctly.

2. **Random Access Needed**

3. **Not Suitable for Small Datasets**  
   For very small datasets, linear search may be faster due to lower overhead.

4. **Insertion and Deletion Overhead**  
   Keeping the data sorted for binary search can be costly, especially if there are frequent insertions and deletions.

5. **Complexity with Duplicates**  
   Handling multiple occurrences of the same element (finding the first or last occurrence) can make the implementation more complex.

When performing binary search on floating point numbers (e.g., searching for a value in a sorted array of doubles or finding a root of a function), you need to account for the imprecision of floating point arithmetic. Here’s how you can handle it:

#### 1. Use an Epsilon (Tolerance)

Instead of checking for exact equality (\`mid == target\`), check if the difference is within a small threshold (epsilon):

\`\`\`python
epsilon = 1e-6  # or some small value appropriate for your problem

while right - left > epsilon:
    mid = (left + right) / 2
    if abs(mid - target) < epsilon:
        return mid
    elif mid < target:
        left = mid
    else:
        right = mid
\`\`\`

#### 2. Stopping Condition

- For arrays: Stop when the difference between \`left\` and \`right\` is less than \`epsilon\`.
- For functions (e.g., root finding): Stop when \`abs(f(mid)) < epsilon\`.

#### 3. Avoid Infinite Loops

Due to floating point rounding, always use the epsilon-based stopping condition instead of relying on \`left <= right\`.

#### 4. Example: Finding Square Root

\`\`\`python
def sqrt_binary_search(x):
    left, right = 0, x
    epsilon = 1e-6
    while right - left > epsilon:
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        if mid * mid < x:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid
    return (left + right) / 2

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set \`left = 0\` and \`right = n - 1\` (where \`n\` is the array length).
2. **Modified Binary Search**:
    - While \`left <= right\`:
        1. Compute \`mid = (left + right) // 2\`.
        2. If \`nums[mid] == target\`, return \`mid\`.
        3. Determine which half is sorted:
            - **Left half is sorted** if \`nums[left] <= nums[mid]\`:
                - If \`nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]\`, search the left half: \`right = mid - 1\`.
                - Else, search the right half: \`left = mid + 1\`.
            - **Right half is sorted** if \`nums[mid] < nums[right]\`:
                - If \`nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]\`, search the right half: \`left = mid + 1\`.
                - Else, search the left half: \`right = mid - 1\`.
3. If the loop ends, return -1 (target not found).

## Example Code (Python)

\`\`\`python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # Left half is sorted
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # Right half is sorted
        else:
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return -1

## Key Insight

At each step, at least one half of the array is sorted. By checking which half is sorted and whether the target lies within that half, you can discard half of the search space, maintaining O(log n) time complexity.

Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.821121Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"},{id:"9dd69cfb-6ccf-4f0c-9a77-1727facc9622",question:"How can binary search be used in competitive programming?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Binary search is a powerful technique widely used in competitive programming to efficiently solve problems involving sorted data or monotonic functions. Here’s how binary search can be applied:

## 1. **Finding Elements in Sorted Arrays**
Binary search quickly locates an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time, which is much faster than linear search.

\`\`\`cpp
int binarySearch(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
    while(left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if(arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if(arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1; // Not found
}
\`\`\`

## 2. **Finding Boundaries (Lower/Upper Bound)**
Binary search helps find the first or last occurrence of a value, or the smallest/largest value satisfying a condition.

- **Lower Bound:** First position where \`arr[i] >= target\`
- **Upper Bound:** First position where \`arr[i] > target\`

## 3. **Answering Range Queries**
When asked to find the number of elements less than or greater than a value in a sorted array, binary search can efficiently compute the answer.

## 4. **Binary Search on the Answer**
For problems where the answer lies within a range and you can check if a candidate answer is valid (monotonic property), binary search can be used to find the optimal answer.

**Example:** Finding the minimum largest sum when splitting an array into \`k\` subarrays.

\`\`\`cpp
bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums, int maxSum, int k) {
    int count = 1, currSum = 0;
    for(int num : nums) {
        if(currSum + num > maxSum) {
            count++;
            currSum = 0;
        }
        currSum += num;
    }
    return count <= k;
}

int splitArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int left = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int right = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    while(left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if(isPossible(nums, mid, k)) right = mid;
        else left = mid + 1;
    }
    return left;
}
\`\`\`

## 5. **Applications Beyond Arrays**
Binary search can be used on:

- **Monotonic functions:** To find roots or thresholds.
- **Search space:** To minimize or maximize a value under constraints.
- **Custom data structures:** Like searching in trees or implicit arrays.

**Summary:**  
In competitive programming, binary search is a versatile tool for solving search and optimization problems efficiently, especially when the problem exhibits a monotonic property or involves sorted data. Mastering binary search and its variants is essential for success in contests.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-21T12:08:07.821127Z",topic:"9bc64376-b554-4c17-8da5-6523f70a22c1"}];export{e as default};
