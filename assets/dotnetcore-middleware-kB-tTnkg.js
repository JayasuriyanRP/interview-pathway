const e=[{id:"d575b402-2015-4003-92b2-b960ad320125",question:"How does middleware work in the ASP.NET Core request pipeline?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown In ASP.NET Core, middleware are components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware in the pipeline can:

- Process the incoming HTTP request.
- Decide whether to pass the request to the next middleware.
- Perform actions on the outgoing HTTP response.

### How Middleware Works

1. **Request Enters the Pipeline:**  
   When a request arrives, it enters the pipeline and passes through each middleware component in the order they are registered.

2. **Processing and Passing Along:**  
   Each middleware can:
   - Perform some logic before passing the request to the next middleware (e.g., logging, authentication).
   - Call the next middleware using \`await next()\` or \`await _next(context)\`.

3. **Short-circuiting:**  
   Middleware can choose not to call the next middleware. This is called "short-circuiting" and is useful for handling errors or terminating requests early.

4. **Response Handling:**  
   As the response travels back through the pipeline, middleware can modify the response (e.g., add headers).

### Example

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        // Logic before next middleware
        await next.Invoke();
        // Logic after next middleware
    });

    app.Run(async (context) =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
    });
}
\`\`\`

- The first middleware does something before and after the next middleware.
- The second middleware writes "Hello, World!" to the response and ends the pipeline.

### Key Points

- Middleware are executed in the order they are added.
- Each middleware can modify the request and response.
- Middleware can stop the pipeline by not calling the next middleware.

**In summary:**  
Middleware in ASP.NET Core are building blocks that process requests and responses in a pipeline, allowing you to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and error handling.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"b4e16de3-b7f5-47b0-afa0-60e58e83a627",question:"How do you register middleware in an ASP.NET Core application?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To register middleware in an ASP.NET Core application, you use the Configure method in the Startup class. Middleware components are added to the HTTP request pipeline using extension methods on the IApplicationBuilder instance, such as UseMiddleware, UseRouting, UseEndpoints, etc.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Register built-in middleware
        app.UseRouting();

        // Register custom middleware
        app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();

        // Register endpoint middleware
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Middleware is registered in the order you want them to execute.
- Use built-in methods like \`UseRouting\`, \`UseAuthentication\`, etc., or \`UseMiddleware<T>()\` for custom middleware.
- Each middleware can perform actions before and after the next middleware in the pipeline.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"1903a350-4f6b-4196-9a62-c1373d55497b",question:"How do you terminate the middleware pipeline?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To terminate the middleware pipeline in .NET Core, you simply do not call the next delegate in your middleware. In a custom middleware, this means not invoking await next(context);. When you omit this call, the pipeline stops processing further middleware components.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
public class TerminatingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public TerminatingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Do something with the context

        // Do NOT call _next(context); to terminate the pipeline
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Pipeline terminated here.");
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
The middleware pipeline is terminated by not calling the next middleware in the sequence. This is typically done by omitting the call to await next(context); in your middleware's Invoke or InvokeAsync method.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"5a9c0e73-dcf8-42dd-8180-c2eb2b4c7035",question:"What is middleware in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

In .NET Core, **middleware** is software that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component:

- Receives an HTTP request.
- Can perform operations before and after the next component in the pipeline.
- Can either pass the request to the next middleware or end the request processing.

Middleware is configured in the \`Startup.cs\` file using the \`Configure\` method. Common examples include authentication, logging, error handling, and static file serving.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>(); // Custom middleware
    app.UseStaticFiles(); // Built-in middleware for static files
    app.UseRouting(); // Routing middleware
    // ... other middleware

### Difference between \`Use\`, \`Run\`, and \`Map\` in .NET Core Middleware Registration

In ASP.NET Core, middleware components are registered in the request pipeline using extension methods: \`Use\`, \`Run\`, and \`Map\`. Here’s how they differ:

#### 1. \`Use\`
- **Purpose:** Adds middleware to the pipeline.
- **Behavior:** Can call the next middleware in the pipeline using \`await next()\`.
- **Usage:** Most common way to register middleware that may or may not pass control to the next component.

\`\`\`csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do something before
    await next();
    // Do something after
});
\`\`\`

#### 2. \`Run\`
- **Purpose:** Adds a terminal middleware to the pipeline.
- **Behavior:** Does **not** call the next middleware; ends the pipeline.
- **Usage:** Used for middleware that should terminate the request, such as returning a response directly.

\`\`\`csharp
app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from Run!");
});
\`\`\`

#### 3. \`Map\`
- **Purpose:** Branches the pipeline based on the request path.
- **Behavior:** Executes a separate middleware pipeline for requests that match a specific path.
- **Usage:** Useful for handling specific routes differently.

\`\`\`csharp
app.Map("/branch", branchApp =>
{
    branchApp.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from /branch!");
    });
});
\`\`\`

`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"9ddc3f13-63f5-4d45-b6ce-f986d3e41c82",question:"How can you create custom middleware in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To create custom middleware in .NET Core, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Middleware Class**

Create a class with a constructor that accepts a \`RequestDelegate\` and a method named \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` that takes an \`HttpContext\` parameter.

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyCustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyCustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Custom logic before next middleware
        Console.WriteLine("Before next middleware");

        await _next(context); // Call the next middleware

        // Custom logic after next middleware
        Console.WriteLine("After next middleware");
    }
}
\`\`\`

2. **Register Middleware in the Pipeline**

In your \`Startup.cs\` (or \`Program.cs\` in .NET 6+), add your middleware to the HTTP request pipeline using the \`UseMiddleware\` extension method:

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();

    // Other middlewares (e.g., routing, endpoints)
}
\`\`\`

**Tip:**  
You can also create an extension method for cleaner registration:

\`\`\`csharp
public static class MyCustomMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseMyCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
    }
}
\`\`\`

Then register it as:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMyCustomMiddleware();
\`\`\`

---

**Summary:**  
- Create a middleware class with \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\`.
- Register it in the middleware pipeline using \`UseMiddleware<T>()\` or a custom extension method.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"8f455e8a-9778-4ebd-8625-560f3e4b956a",question:"What is the order of middleware execution in the pipeline?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
In .NET Core, middleware components are executed in the order they are added to the application's request pipeline. This order is defined in the \`Configure\` method of the \`Startup\` class. Each middleware can perform actions both before and after the next middleware in the pipeline is invoked.

**Key Points:**
- Middleware is executed in the sequence it is registered.
- The order matters because each middleware can short-circuit the pipeline or modify the request/response.
- The typical pattern is:
  1. The request enters the first middleware.
  2. Each middleware can process the request and then call the next middleware.
  3. The response travels back through the middleware in reverse order.

**Example:**
\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<FirstMiddleware>();   // Executed first
    app.UseMiddleware<SecondMiddleware>();  // Executed second
    app.UseMiddleware<ThirdMiddleware>();   // Executed third
}
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
The order in which middleware is added to the pipeline determines the order of execution for both incoming requests and outgoing responses.
\`\`\`
`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"f2aa8aca-bf3f-4b60-9914-95546e156c0f",question:"How can you pass data between different middleware components?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown You can pass data between different middleware components in .NET Core by using the HttpContext object. Each middleware in the pipeline receives the same HttpContext instance, so you can store and retrieve data using its Items property, which is a key-value collection.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
// Middleware 1: Store data
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    context.Items["MyData"] = "Hello from Middleware 1";
    await next.Invoke();
});

// Middleware 2: Retrieve data
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    var data = context.Items["MyData"] as string;
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(data); // Outputs: Hello from Middleware 1
    await next.Invoke();
});
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
Use \`HttpContext.Items\` to share data between middleware components. This is a simple and thread-safe way to pass information along the request pipeline.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"d33c5759-3696-40d0-b094-54ec4cdfa1d7",question:"What is the purpose of the next delegate in middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown The next delegate in .NET Core middleware represents the next piece of middleware in the HTTP request processing pipeline. Its purpose is to pass control to the subsequent middleware component. When you call await next(context); (or simply next(context); in synchronous code), the request continues down the pipeline. If you don’t call next, the pipeline stops and the response is returned immediately.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Do something before the next middleware
        await _next(context); // Call the next middleware
        // Do something after the next middleware
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
The next delegate allows middleware components to be chained together, enabling each one to process the request and/or response as it moves through the pipeline.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"f07ddecf-bc5c-4d0e-9745-f55049d27e3b",question:"How do you add built-in middleware like authentication or static files?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To add built-in middleware like authentication or static files in .NET Core, you use the middleware extension methods in the Configure method of your Startup class. Here’s how you can do it:

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // Add static files middleware
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    // Add authentication middleware
    app.UseAuthentication();

    // Add authorization middleware (optional, but common with authentication)
    app.UseAuthorization();

    // Other middleware (e.g., routing)
    app.UseRouting();

    // Endpoint configuration
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
\`\`\`

**Explanation:**

- \`app.UseStaticFiles();\` enables serving static files (like HTML, CSS, JS) from the wwwroot folder.
- \`app.UseAuthentication();\` adds authentication middleware to the pipeline.
- \`app.UseAuthorization();\` adds authorization middleware (usually after authentication).
- Middleware order matters! Place them in the correct sequence as shown above.

**Note:**  
Before using authentication or authorization middleware, make sure you have configured the required services in the \`ConfigureServices\` method. For static files, no extra configuration is needed unless you want custom options.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"477f0528-b656-4db0-affb-6fbb6180602f",question:"What is the difference between app.Use and app.Run?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **app.Use vs. app.Run in .NET Core Middleware**

In .NET Core, both app.Use and app.Run are used to add middleware components to the HTTP request pipeline, but they behave differently:

### app.Use

- **Purpose:** Adds middleware that can perform actions both before and after the next middleware in the pipeline.
- **Chaining:** Can call the next middleware using \`await next()\`.
- **Multiple Uses:** You can use \`app.Use\` multiple times to build a chain of middleware.

**Example:**
\`\`\`csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do something before
    await next();
    // Do something after
});
\`\`\`

---

### app.Run

- **Purpose:** Adds a terminal middleware that handles the request and does **not** call the next middleware.
- **Chaining:** Does **not** call \`next()\`. This ends the pipeline.
- **Single Use:** Typically used once at the end of the pipeline.

**Example:**
\`\`\`csharp
app.Run(async (context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from app.Run!");
});
\`\`\`

**In short:**  
- Use \`app.Use\` for middleware that should pass control to the next component.
- Use \`app.Run\` for the final middleware that should handle the request and end the pipeline.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"a34beb53-3c70-4f51-a6c3-d2e10dc9694a",question:"How do you conditionally execute middleware based on the request path?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown You can conditionally execute middleware in .NET Core based on the request path by using the \`Map\`, \`MapWhen\`, or by adding logic inside your middleware. Here are the common approaches:

### 1. Using \`Map\` or \`MapWhen\`

- **\`Map\`**: Branches the middleware pipeline based on a matching path prefix.

\`\`\`csharp
app.Map("/api", apiApp =>
{
    apiApp.UseMiddleware<YourMiddleware>();
    // Other middlewares specific to /api
});
\`\`\`

- **\`MapWhen\`**: Branches the pipeline based on a predicate.

\`\`\`csharp
app.MapWhen(context => context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/admin"), adminApp =>
{
    adminApp.UseMiddleware<YourMiddleware>();
    // Other middlewares specific to /admin
});
\`\`\`

### 2. Conditional Logic Inside Middleware

You can also check the path inside your middleware and decide whether to execute logic or simply call the next middleware.

\`\`\`csharp
public class ConditionalMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ConditionalMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/special"))
        {
            // Execute middleware logic
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| \`Map\`         | Path prefix branching                          |

**Choose the method that best fits your scenario for clean and maintainable code.**`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"1de901e1-1a04-470d-a748-11f610fac1cc",question:"What is the purpose of the app.Map method?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown The app.Map method in .NET Core middleware is used to conditionally branch the request pipeline based on the request path. It allows you to define middleware that only runs when the request URL matches a specified path. This is useful for organizing your middleware logic and handling different routes separately.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
app.Map("/admin", adminApp =>
{
    adminApp.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        // Middleware logic for /admin path
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Admin area");
    });
});
\`\`\`

**Purpose:**

- **Route-based branching:** Only executes the middleware inside the Map block if the request path starts with the specified segment (e.g., /admin).
- **Separation of concerns:** Helps organize middleware for different parts of your application.
- **Cleaner pipeline:** Prevents unnecessary middleware execution for unrelated routes.

**In summary:**  
app.Map is used to branch the middleware pipeline based on the request path, enabling modular and efficient handling of different application routes.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"910b65fa-75f6-452d-afcd-4003a53c0460",question:"How do you inject dependencies into custom middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To inject dependencies into custom middleware in .NET Core, you should use **constructor injection**. The middleware class can declare dependencies in its constructor, and these will be provided by the built-in dependency injection (DI) system.

Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Define Your Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyCustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public MyCustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IMyService myService)
    {
        _next = next;
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Use _myService here
        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Register Dependencies in \`Startup.cs\`

\`\`\`csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Add Middleware to the Pipeline

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
}
\`\`\`

### Key Points

- The middleware’s constructor can accept any services registered with the DI container.
- The first parameter **must** be \`RequestDelegate next\`.
- .NET Core will automatically resolve and inject the dependencies when the middleware is added with \`UseMiddleware<T>()\`.

---

**Summary:**  
To inject dependencies into custom middleware, add them as constructor parameters (after \`RequestDelegate next\`), register them in the DI container, and use \`app.UseMiddleware<YourMiddleware>()\` to add the middleware to the pipeline.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"2fb0836c-94b3-4362-9809-82a2d61ecfa3",question:"What is the role of the HttpContext object in middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown The \`HttpContext\` object in .NET Core middleware acts as a central container for all HTTP-specific information about an individual request. Its role in middleware includes:

- **Accessing Request Data:** Middleware can read details such as headers, query strings, cookies, and the request body via \`HttpContext.Request\`.
- **Modifying the Response:** Middleware can set status codes, headers, and write to the response body using \`HttpContext.Response\`.
- **Passing Data:** Middleware can store and retrieve data during the request's lifetime using \`HttpContext.Items\`, enabling communication between different middleware components.
- **User and Authentication:** Middleware can access authentication and user information through \`HttpContext.User\`.
- **Short-circuiting the Pipeline:** Middleware can decide to stop further processing and generate a response directly, using the \`HttpContext\`.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
{
    // Access request information
    var path = context.Request.Path;

    // Add a custom header to the response
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Custom-Header", "Value");

    // Store data for later middleware
    context.Items["StartTime"] = DateTime.UtcNow;

    await _next(context); // Call the next middleware
}
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
\`HttpContext\` provides middleware with all the tools needed to inspect, modify, and interact with HTTP requests and responses as they flow through the pipeline.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"c5106e67-7d67-4eff-b6af-10abf6763262",question:"How can you handle exceptions globally using middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To handle exceptions globally in .NET Core, you can create custom middleware that catches exceptions thrown during the request pipeline and handles them in a centralized way. Here’s how you can do it:

\`\`\`csharp
public class ExceptionHandlingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> _logger;

    public ExceptionHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context); // Call the next middleware
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "An unhandled exception has occurred.");
            context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
            var result = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { error = "An unexpected error occurred." });
            await context.Response.WriteAsync(result);
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Register the middleware in \`Startup.cs\` or \`Program.cs\`:**

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- The middleware wraps the request pipeline in a try-catch block.
- Any unhandled exception is logged and a generic error response is returned.
- This approach ensures all exceptions are handled in one place, improving maintainability and consistency.

    }

    private async Task DoSomethingAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Example asynchronous operation
        await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate async work
    }

    private async Task DoSomethingElseAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Another example asynchronous operation
        await Task.Delay(100);
    }
}

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<MyAsyncMiddleware>();
    // Other middleware registrations
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- The middleware’s \`InvokeAsync\` method must return a \`Task\`.
- Use \`await\` for asynchronous operations.
- Always call \`await _next(context)\` to pass control to the next middleware.
- Register your middleware in the pipeline using \`app.UseMiddleware<T>()\`.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"68d8f916-0253-47d1-a4a2-3451816f4861",question:"What are some common built-in middleware components in ASP.NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Some common built-in middleware components in ASP.NET Core include:

- **Static Files Middleware**  
  Serves static files such as HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript from the wwwroot folder.

- **Routing Middleware**

Here’s how you can do it:

\`\`\`csharp
public class MethodSpecificMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MethodSpecificMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Check if the HTTP method is POST
        if (context.Request.Method == HttpMethods.Post)
        {
            // Middleware logic for POST requests
            // ...
        }

        // Call the next middleware in the pipeline
        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Registering the Middleware:**
\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<MethodSpecificMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

### Alternative: Use MapWhen

You can also use \`app.MapWhen\` to branch the middleware pipeline for specific HTTP methods:

\`\`\`csharp
app.MapWhen(
    context => context.Request.Method == HttpMethods.Post,
    appBuilder =>
    {
        appBuilder.UseMiddleware<YourMiddleware>();
    });
\`\`\`

### Summary

- **Inside Middleware:** Check \`context.Request.Method\` and execute logic conditionally.
- **With MapWhen:** Branch the pipeline so middleware only runs for specific methods.

This approach ensures your middleware only processes requests with the desired HTTP methods.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"e61e46dc-cbcc-4f1a-b2f1-9c0be000c892",question:"How can you short-circuit the middleware pipeline?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To short-circuit the middleware pipeline in .NET Core, you can simply avoid calling the next delegate within your middleware. This prevents any subsequent middleware from executing. Here's an example:

\`\`\`csharp
public class ShortCircuitMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ShortCircuitMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/short-circuit"))
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 403;
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Request short-circuited!");
            // Do NOT call _next(context), so the pipeline stops here.
            return;
        }

        // Continue to the next middleware
        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Not calling await _next(context) will stop the pipeline.
- This is useful for handling requests early (e.g., authentication failures, maintenance mode).
- Any middleware registered after this one will not execute for short-circuited requests.

**Registration in Startup.cs:**
\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<ShortCircuitMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
To short-circuit the pipeline, simply do not call the next middleware in your custom middleware logic.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"1e33e9b2-8e09-4987-b006-c1b8521bd753",question:"What is the difference between inline and class-based middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Difference Between Inline and Class-Based Middleware in .NET Core**

In .NET Core, middleware can be implemented in two main ways: **inline** and **class-based**. Here’s how they differ:

### Inline Middleware

- **Definition:** Inline middleware is defined directly within the \`Startup.Configure\` method using lambda expressions.
- **Usage:** Typically used for simple, short logic that doesn’t require reuse.
- **Example:**

  \`\`\`csharp
  app.Use(async (context, next) =>
  {
      // Do something before
      await next.Invoke();
      // Do something after
  });
  \`\`\`

- **Pros:**
  - Quick and easy for simple tasks.
  - No need to create a separate class.

- **Cons:**
  - Not reusable.
  - Can clutter the \`Startup\` class if overused.
  - Harder to test and maintain for complex logic.

---

### Class-Based Middleware

- **Definition:** Class-based middleware is implemented as a separate class, usually with a constructor and an \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` method.
- **Usage:** Preferred for complex, reusable, or testable middleware logic.
- **Example:**

  \`\`\`csharp
  public class CustomMiddleware
  {
      private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

      public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
      {
          _next = next;
      }

      public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
      {
          // Do something before
          await _next(context);
          // Do something after
      }
  }

  // In Startup.Configure:
  app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
  \`\`\`

- **Pros:**
  - Promotes code reuse and separation of concerns.
  - Easier to test and maintain.
  - Supports dependency injection.

- **Cons:**
  - Slightly more boilerplate code.

**In summary:**  
Use **inline middleware** for quick, simple tasks. Use **class-based middleware** for more complex, reusable, or testable logic.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"0c544c6c-5366-45e8-a3e2-035805c2acfb",question:"How do you test custom middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To test custom middleware in .NET Core, you can use unit tests with the help of libraries like xUnit and Moq. The general approach is to:

1. **Isolate the middleware logic** by mocking dependencies.
2. **Create a mock HttpContext** to simulate HTTP requests and responses.
3. **Invoke the middleware** directly in your test, passing the mock context and a delegate representing the next middleware.
4. **Assert the expected behavior** (e.g., response status, headers, or that the next middleware was called).

### Example

Suppose you have a simple custom middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
public class SampleMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public SampleMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Custom-Header", "Value");
        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### Unit Test Example (using xUnit and Moq)

\`\`\`csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Moq;
using Xunit;

public class SampleMiddlewareTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task InvokeAsync_AddsCustomHeader()
    {
        // Arrange
        var context = new DefaultHttpContext();
        var mockNext = new Mock<RequestDelegate>();
        mockNext.Setup(next => next(It.IsAny<HttpContext>())).Returns(Task.CompletedTask);

        var middleware = new SampleMiddleware(mockNext.Object);

        // Act
        await middleware.InvokeAsync(context);

        // Assert
        Assert.True(context.Response.Headers.ContainsKey("X-Custom-Header"));
        Assert.Equal("Value", context.Response.Headers["X-Custom-Header"]);
        mockNext.Verify(next => next(context), Times.Once);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Tips

- Use \`DefaultHttpContext\` for a simple mock context.
- Mock services or dependencies if your middleware uses dependency injection.
- Test both positive and negative scenarios (e.g., error handling, short-circuiting).

**Summary:**  
Testing custom middleware involves creating a mock HTTP context, invoking the middleware, and asserting the expected changes or behaviors. This ensures your middleware works as intended in isolation.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"45ac8e76-8d55-4e58-beb7-07550b3e2ce3",question:"How can you share data between middleware and controllers?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown You can share data between middleware and controllers in .NET Core by using the HttpContext.Items collection. This is a key-value dictionary that exists for the lifetime of a single HTTP request, making it ideal for passing data from middleware to controllers (or other components handling the same request).

**Example:**

**1. Middleware:**

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyCustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyCustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Set data in HttpContext.Items
        context.Items["MyData"] = "Hello from Middleware!";
        
        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**2. Register Middleware in Startup:**

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
    // other middlewares...
}
\`\`\`

**3. Access Data in Controller:**

\`\`\`csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        // Retrieve data from HttpContext.Items
        var data = HttpContext.Items["MyData"] as string;
        ViewBag.Message = data;
        return View();
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**

- \`HttpContext.Items\` is a per-request storage dictionary.
- Data stored here is available to all middleware and controllers handling the same request.
- Avoid storing large objects or data that needs to persist beyond the request.

**References:**

- [Microsoft Docs: HttpContext.Items](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpcontext.items)`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"bd19f4a8-632a-49c5-af1c-85fba30075f0",question:"What is the purpose of UseWhen in middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown The UseWhen method in .NET Core middleware is used to conditionally execute a branch of middleware based on a predicate. It allows you to specify a condition (a function that returns true or false based on the HttpContext), and if the condition is met, a specific middleware pipeline is executed for that request. Otherwise, the main pipeline continues as normal.

**Purpose of UseWhen:**

- **Conditional Middleware Execution:** UseWhen enables you to apply certain middleware only to requests that meet specific criteria, such as a particular path, header, or query string.
- **Cleaner Pipeline:** It helps keep the main middleware pipeline clean and organized by isolating conditional logic.
- **Performance:** By only executing certain middleware when necessary, you can improve performance and avoid unnecessary processing.

**Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api"), appBuilder =>
{
    appBuilder.UseMiddleware<CustomApiMiddleware>();
});
\`\`\`

In this example, CustomApiMiddleware will only run for requests where the path starts with /api.

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Conditional Execution  | Runs middleware only when a predicate returns true       |
| Cleaner Code           | Keeps conditional logic out of the main pipeline         |
| Performance            | Avoids unnecessary middleware execution                  |

**References:**

Here’s how you can modify both the request and the response:

### 1. Modifying the Request

You can access and modify the incoming request via the \`HttpContext.Request\` object before calling the next middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
{
    // Example: Add a custom header to the request
    context.Request.Headers["X-Custom-Request-Header"] = "MyValue";

    // Call the next middleware in the pipeline
    await _next(context);
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Modifying the Response

To modify the response, you typically make changes after calling \`await _next(context)\`, which ensures that the response has been generated by downstream middleware or the endpoint:

\`\`\`csharp
public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
{
    // Call the next middleware first
    await _next(context);

    // Example: Add a custom header to the response
    context.Response.Headers["X-Custom-Response-Header"] = "MyValue";
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Modifying the Response Body

If you need to modify the response body, you can replace the response stream with a memory stream, process the output, and then write it back:

\`\`\`csharp
public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
{
    var originalBodyStream = context.Response.Body;

    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        context.Response.Body = memoryStream;

        await _next(context);

        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
        var responseBody = new StreamReader(memoryStream).ReadToEnd();

        // Modify the response body as needed
        var modifiedBody = responseBody.Replace("foo", "bar");

        // Write the modified content back to the original stream
        var modifiedBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(modifiedBody);
        originalBodyStream.Write(modifiedBytes, 0, modifiedBytes.Length);

        context.Response.Body = originalBodyStream;
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Registering Middleware

Register your middleware in the \`Startup.Configure\` method:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<YourCustomMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

---

**Summary:**  
- Modify requests before calling \`await _next(context)\`.
- Modify responses after calling \`await _next(context)\`.
- For response body changes, use a memory stream to intercept and modify the output.
- Always restore the original response stream after modification.

This approach allows you to flexibly manipulate both requests and responses as they pass through the middleware pipeline.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"05fb0c32-2cb7-4c43-90d4-1a149da118a1",question:"How do you implement logging in middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To implement logging in .NET Core middleware, you typically inject an \`ILogger<T>\` into your middleware and use it to log information as requests are processed. Here’s a step-by-step example:

1. **Create the Middleware Class**

\`\`\`csharp
public class LoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingMiddleware> _logger;

    public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<LoggingMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Log request details
        _logger.LogInformation("Handling request: {Method} {Path}", context.Request.Method, context.Request.Path);

        await _next(context);

        // Log response details
        _logger.LogInformation("Finished handling request. Response status: {StatusCode}", context.Response.StatusCode);
    }
}
\`\`\`

2. **Register the Middleware in the Pipeline**

In your \`Startup.cs\` (for .NET Core 3.1 and earlier) or \`Program.cs\` (for .NET 6 and later):

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>();
    // ... other middleware registrations
}
\`\`\`

3. **Configure Logging Providers (Optional)**

You can configure logging providers (Console, Debug, etc.) in \`appsettings.json\` or in \`Program.cs\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

4. **Result**

With this setup, every request and response will be logged using the configured logging providers.

---

**Summary:**  
- Inject \`ILogger<T>\` into your middleware.
- Use \`_logger.LogInformation\`, \`_logger.LogWarning\`, etc., to log messages.
- Register the middleware in the request pipeline.

When developing custom middleware in .NET Core, performance is a critical aspect to ensure your application remains responsive and scalable. Here are key considerations:

#### 1. **Minimize Synchronous Blocking**
- **Avoid synchronous I/O**: Use asynchronous methods (\`await\`/\`async\`) for I/O operations to prevent thread starvation.
- **Do not use \`.Result\` or \`.Wait()\`**: These can cause deadlocks and reduce throughput.

#### 2. **Efficient Request Processing**
- **Short-circuit when possible**: If your middleware can determine early that further processing is unnecessary, return a response immediately to save resources.
- **Minimal work per request**: Only perform essential logic; offload heavy processing to background services if possible.

#### 3. **Memory Management**
- **Avoid large object allocations**: Reuse objects where possible (e.g., use \`ArrayPool<T>\` or \`StringBuilderPool\`).
- **Beware of memory leaks**: Don’t hold references to \`HttpContext\` or other request-specific objects beyond the request scope.

#### 4. **Exception Handling**
- **Handle exceptions efficiently**: Catch only what you can handle and avoid swallowing exceptions unnecessarily, as this can hide bugs and increase debugging time.

#### 5. **Pipeline Ordering**
- **Order matters**: Place performance-critical middleware (e.g., static file serving, caching) early in the pipeline to reduce unnecessary processing.

#### 6. **Logging and Diagnostics**
- **Minimize logging overhead**: Log only what is necessary and use asynchronous logging providers if available.
- **Conditional diagnostics**: Enable expensive diagnostics (like detailed tracing) only in development or when troubleshooting.

#### 7. **Avoid Unnecessary Work**
- **Check request path/headers early**: If your middleware only applies to certain routes or conditions, check these as soon as possible.
- **Don’t duplicate work**: Ensure your middleware doesn’t repeat logic already handled by other middleware/components.

#### 8. **Thread Safety**
- **Avoid shared mutable state**: Middleware is typically singleton; use thread-safe patterns or avoid shared state.

#### 9. **Use Built-in Features**
- **Leverage framework capabilities**: Use built-in middleware (e.g., compression, caching) when possible, as they are highly optimized.

#### 10. **Profiling and Benchmarking**
- **Measure impact**: Use tools like BenchmarkDotNet, Application Insights, or built-in ASP.NET Core diagnostics to profile and optimize your middleware.

By adhering to these practices, you can write efficient, scalable, and maintainable custom middleware in .NET Core.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"9bb6b981-68fc-4aca-b3e4-00e1e9d7745d",question:"How can you implement middleware that supports dependency injection with scoped services?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To implement middleware in .NET Core that supports dependency injection (DI) with scoped services, you should **not** inject scoped services directly into the middleware's constructor. This is because middleware is registered as a singleton, and injecting a scoped service into a singleton can cause incorrect lifetimes and potential issues.

Instead, inject \`IServiceProvider\` into the middleware constructor, and resolve the scoped service within the \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` method, which is called per request and thus within the correct scope.

### Example

Suppose you have a scoped service:

\`\`\`csharp
public interface IMyScopedService
{
    void DoWork();
}

public class MyScopedService : IMyScopedService
{
    public void DoWork()
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
\`\`\`

Register it as scoped in \`Startup.cs\` or \`Program.cs\`:

\`\`\`csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyScopedService, MyScopedService>();
\`\`\`

#### Middleware Implementation

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _next = next;
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Resolve the scoped service within the request scope
        var myScopedService = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IMyScopedService>();
        myScopedService.DoWork();

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### Registering the Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

### Key Points

- **Do not inject scoped services directly into the middleware constructor.**
- Use \`IServiceProvider\` or \`HttpContext.RequestServices\` to resolve scoped services per request.
- This ensures the correct service lifetime and avoids DI container errors.

Handling Streaming Large Request or Response Bodies in .NET Core Middleware
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When dealing with large request or response bodies in .NET Core middleware, it’s important to avoid buffering the entire content in memory, as this can lead to high memory consumption and degraded performance. Instead, you should process the data as a stream. Here’s how you can handle streaming efficiently:

### Streaming Large Request Bodies

By default, ASP.NET Core does not buffer the request body, so you can read it as a stream. However, if you need to inspect or modify the request body in middleware, you must be careful not to consume the stream in a way that prevents downstream components from accessing it.

**Example: Reading and Forwarding the Request Body as a Stream**

\`\`\`csharp
public class StreamingRequestMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public StreamingRequestMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Enable buffering if you need to read the body multiple times
        // context.Request.EnableBuffering();

        using (var reader = new StreamReader(context.Request.Body, leaveOpen: true))
        {
            // Process the stream in chunks
            char[] buffer = new char[8192];
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = await reader.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                // Process buffer[0..bytesRead]
            }

            // Reset the stream position if needed
            // context.Request.Body.Position = 0;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Use \`StreamReader\` or read directly from \`context.Request.Body\`.
- Avoid reading the entire body into memory.
- If you need to read the body multiple times, use \`EnableBuffering()\` and reset the position.

### Streaming Large Response Bodies

To stream large responses, wrap the \`HttpContext.Response.Body\` stream. You can intercept and process the data as it is written, or replace the stream with your own implementation.

**Example: Streaming Response Body**

\`\`\`csharp
public class StreamingResponseMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public StreamingResponseMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var originalBodyStream = context.Response.Body;

        using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            context.Response.Body = stream;

            await _next(context);

            stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

            // Process the response stream in chunks
            byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
            {
                // Optionally modify buffer[0..bytesRead]
                await originalBodyStream.WriteAsync(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            }
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Replace \`context.Response.Body\` with your own stream.
- Process and forward data in chunks to avoid buffering the entire response.
- For truly large streaming scenarios (e.g., file downloads), avoid buffering at all and write directly to the response stream.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid Buffering:** Do not read the entire body into memory unless absolutely necessary.
- **Chunked Processing:** Process data in manageable chunks.
- **Leave Streams Open:** When wrapping streams, use \`leaveOpen: true\` to avoid disposing the underlying stream.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use async read/write methods to avoid blocking threads.

Reusable middleware libraries allow you to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, authentication, or error handling) and share them across multiple ASP.NET Core projects. Here’s how you can create such libraries:

---

#### 1. **Create a Class Library Project**

- Use the .NET CLI or Visual Studio to create a new **Class Library** targeting \`.NET Standard\` or \`.NET Core\`.
- Add the necessary NuGet references, especially \`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions\`.

\`\`\`bash
dotnet new classlib -n MyReusableMiddleware
cd MyReusableMiddleware
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions
\`\`\`

---

#### 2. **Implement the Middleware**

- Create a class with a constructor that accepts a \`RequestDelegate\`.
- Implement the \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` method.

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyCustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyCustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Pre-processing logic here

        await _next(context);

        // Post-processing logic here
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

#### 3. **Add an Extension Method**

- Provide an extension method for \`IApplicationBuilder\` to make it easy to add your middleware in the \`Startup\` class.

\`\`\`csharp
public static class MyCustomMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseMyCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

#### 4. **Package and Distribute**

- Add a \`.nuspec\` file or use the \`.csproj\` to specify package metadata.
- Pack your library:

\`\`\`bash
dotnet pack
\`\`\`

- Publish to a NuGet feed (private or public).

---

#### 5. **Consume the Middleware in ASP.NET Core Apps**

- Reference your NuGet package.
- Register the middleware in the \`Startup.Configure\` method:

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMyCustomMiddleware();
    // Other middleware registrations...
}
\`\`\`

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Keep dependencies minimal** to maximize compatibility.
- **Avoid application-specific logic**; focus on generic, reusable functionality.
- **Support configuration** via options pattern if needed.
- **Document usage** and provide samples.

---

### Best Practices for Exception Handling in .NET Core Middleware

Exception handling in .NET Core middleware is crucial for building robust and maintainable web applications. Here are the best practices:

#### 1. **Centralize Exception Handling**
- Use a global exception handling middleware (such as \`UseExceptionHandler\` or custom middleware) early in the pipeline to catch unhandled exceptions.
- Avoid handling exceptions in every middleware unless necessary.

#### 2. **Order Matters**
- Place the exception handling middleware as close to the beginning of the pipeline as possible, before other middleware that might throw exceptions.

#### 3. **Do Not Swallow Exceptions**
- Log exceptions and return appropriate responses, but do not suppress them silently.
- Use logging frameworks like Serilog, NLog, or built-in ILogger.

#### 4. **Return Meaningful Responses**
- For APIs, return standardized error responses (e.g., Problem Details as per RFC 7807).
- Avoid exposing sensitive details (like stack traces) in production.

#### 5. **Handle Specific Exceptions When Needed**
- Catch and handle specific exceptions if you need to provide custom responses (e.g., validation errors, authentication failures).

#### 6. **Use \`async\`/\`await\` Properly**
- Ensure your middleware is fully asynchronous to avoid deadlocks and ensure exceptions propagate correctly.

#### 7. **Do Not Catch Exceptions You Can’t Handle**
- Let exceptions bubble up to the centralized handler unless you have a specific recovery or logging strategy.

#### 8. **Log Contextual Information**
- Log relevant request data (e.g., request path, headers) to help with debugging.

#### 9. **Avoid Throwing Exceptions for Control Flow**
- Use exceptions for exceptional situations, not for normal control flow.

#### 10. **Test Exception Scenarios**
- Write integration tests to ensure your middleware handles exceptions as expected.

---

#### **Example: Custom Exception Handling Middleware**

\`\`\`csharp
public class ExceptionHandlingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> _logger;

    public ExceptionHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Unhandled exception occurred.");
            context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
            await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { error = "An unexpected error occurred." }));
        }
    }
}

`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"8154cce0-c92f-43b2-9377-3dcbdaa28a16",question:"How do you ensure thread safety in custom middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To ensure thread safety in custom middleware in .NET Core, you should follow these best practices:

### 1. Avoid Storing State in Middleware Instances

Middleware components are typically registered as singletons. This means a single instance of your middleware class will handle requests for the application's lifetime. **Do not store per-request or mutable state in instance fields**.

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    // ❌ Not thread-safe!
    private int _counter;

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _counter++; // Race condition!
        await next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Use Local Variables for Per-Request State

Store any per-request data in local variables within the \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` method.

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        int perRequestCounter = 0; // Thread-safe
        perRequestCounter++;
        await next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Use Thread-Safe Collections or Synchronization

If you must share data across requests (e.g., for caching or statistics), use thread-safe collections such as \`ConcurrentDictionary\`, or use locks (\`lock\`, \`Monitor\`, etc.) to synchronize access.

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, int> _requestCounts = new();

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _requestCounts.AddOrUpdate(context.Request.Path, 1, (key, count) => count + 1);
        await next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Prefer Dependency Injection for Shared Services

If you need to share services or data, register them with the appropriate lifetime (\`Scoped\`, \`Singleton\`, \`Transient\`) and ensure their thread safety.

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly IMyService _service;

    public MyMiddleware(IMyService service)
    {
        _service = service; // Ensure IMyService is thread-safe if singleton
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        await _service.DoWorkAsync();
        await next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 5. Avoid Async Void

Always use \`async Task\` for asynchronous middleware to avoid unobserved exceptions and potential race conditions.

Always avoid storing mutable state in middleware instance fields, use thread-safe patterns for shared data, and leverage dependency injection appropriately to ensure thread safety in custom middleware.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"215246b0-eb95-41e5-9ad0-38ea1859609a",question:"How can you implement middleware that modifies the response headers after the response body has started?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Modifying response headers after the response body has started is generally not possible in ASP.NET Core, because HTTP protocol requires headers to be sent before the body. However, you can work around this limitation by buffering the response body in your middleware, allowing you to modify headers before the buffered content is sent to the client.

Here's how you can implement such middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
public class ResponseBufferingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ResponseBufferingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Keep a reference to the original response body stream
        var originalBodyStream = context.Response.Body;

        using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            // Replace the response body with our memory stream
            context.Response.Body = memoryStream;

            // Call the next middleware in the pipeline
            await _next(context);

            // Now, you can modify headers here, since the body hasn't been sent yet
            context.Response.Headers["X-Custom-Header"] = "MyValue";

            // Rewind the memory stream and copy it to the original stream
            memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
            await memoryStream.CopyToAsync(originalBodyStream);

            // Restore the original response body stream
            context.Response.Body = originalBodyStream;
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Usage in Startup:**

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<ResponseBufferingMiddleware>();
    // ... other middleware
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**

- This middleware buffers the entire response in memory, so use it judiciously (avoid for large responses).
- You can modify headers after the next middleware has run, but before the response is actually sent.
- If the response is very large or streaming is required, consider alternative approaches.

**References:**

To implement middleware for multi-tenant applications in .NET Core, you typically need to identify the tenant for each incoming request and make tenant-specific data (like connection strings, settings, etc.) available throughout the request pipeline. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Define a Tenant Model

\`\`\`csharp
public class Tenant
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
    // Add other tenant-specific properties
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Create a Tenant Resolver Service

This service determines the tenant based on the request (e.g., from the host, path, or headers).

\`\`\`csharp
public interface ITenantResolver
{
    Tenant Resolve(HttpContext context);
}

public class HostTenantResolver : ITenantResolver
{
    private readonly IDictionary<string, Tenant> _tenants;

    public HostTenantResolver(IDictionary<string, Tenant> tenants)
    {
        _tenants = tenants;
    }

    public Tenant Resolve(HttpContext context)
    {
        var host = context.Request.Host.Host;
        return _tenants.TryGetValue(host, out var tenant) ? tenant : null;
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Implement the Middleware

The middleware resolves the tenant and stores it in the request context (e.g., \`HttpContext.Items\`).

\`\`\`csharp
public class TenantMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ITenantResolver _tenantResolver;

    public TenantMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ITenantResolver tenantResolver)
    {
        _next = next;
        _tenantResolver = tenantResolver;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var tenant = _tenantResolver.Resolve(context);
        if (tenant == null)
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status404NotFound;
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Tenant not found");
            return;
        }

        context.Items["Tenant"] = tenant;
        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Register Middleware and Services

In \`Startup.cs\` or \`Program.cs\`:

\`\`\`csharp
var tenants = new Dictionary<string, Tenant>
{
    ["tenant1.example.com"] = new Tenant { Id = "1", Name = "Tenant 1", ConnectionString = "..." },
    ["tenant2.example.com"] = new Tenant { Id = "2", Name = "Tenant 2", ConnectionString = "..." }
};

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ITenantResolver>(new HostTenantResolver(tenants));
app.UseMiddleware<TenantMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

### 5. Access Tenant Information in Controllers/Services

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        var tenant = HttpContext.Items["Tenant"] as Tenant;
        // Use tenant-specific logic
        return Ok($"Hello, {tenant.Name}!");
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Key Points

- **Tenant identification** can be based on host, path, headers, or query string.
- Store tenant info in \`HttpContext.Items\` for per-request access.
- Use dependency injection for tenant-aware services (e.g., database context).
- Consider thread safety and performance when resolving tenants.

This approach provides a flexible and scalable way to support multi-tenancy in .NET Core applications using middleware.

Here’s how you can do it:

\`\`\`csharp
public class RequestTimingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<RequestTimingMiddleware> _logger;

    public RequestTimingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<RequestTimingMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();

        await _next(context); // Call the next middleware

        stopwatch.Stop();
        var elapsedMs = stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds;

        _logger.LogInformation(
            "Request [{Method}] {Url} processed in {ElapsedMilliseconds} ms",
            context.Request.Method,
            context.Request.Path,
            elapsedMs
        );
    }
}
\`\`\`

**To register the middleware in your pipeline:**

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<RequestTimingMiddleware>();
    // ... other middleware registrations
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Use \`Stopwatch\` to measure elapsed time.
- Place timing logic before and after \`await _next(context)\` to capture the full processing time.
- Log the result using the built-in logging framework.
- Register the middleware early in the pipeline for accurate measurement.

This approach provides a reusable and centralized way to monitor request performance in your .NET Core applications.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"d8840423-cf75-480d-9633-0a3b51d20884",question:"How do you implement correlation IDs using middleware?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To implement correlation IDs in .NET Core using middleware, you need to:

1. **Create a Middleware Class**  
   This middleware will check for an existing correlation ID in the incoming request headers. If not present, it will generate a new one, add it to the request context, and include it in the response headers.

2. **Register the Middleware in the Pipeline**  
   Add your middleware to the \`Startup.cs\` (or \`Program.cs\` in .NET 6+) pipeline.

---

### Example Implementation

#### 1. Correlation ID Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
public class CorrelationIdMiddleware
{
    private const string CorrelationIdHeader = "X-Correlation-ID";
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CorrelationIdMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Try to get the correlation ID from the request header
        if (!context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(CorrelationIdHeader, out var correlationId))
        {
            correlationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        }

        // Store the correlation ID for later use (e.g., in logging)
        context.Items[CorrelationIdHeader] = correlationId;

        // Add the correlation ID to the response header
        context.Response.OnStarting(() =>
        {
            context.Response.Headers[CorrelationIdHeader] = correlationId;
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        });

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Register Middleware

**.NET 6+ (\`Program.cs\`):**
\`\`\`csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseMiddleware<CorrelationIdMiddleware>();

// ... other middleware and endpoints

app.Run();
\`\`\`

**.NET Core 3.1/5 (\`Startup.cs\`):**
\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<CorrelationIdMiddleware>();
    // ... other middleware
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Accessing Correlation ID in Controllers/Services

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        var correlationId = HttpContext.Items["X-Correlation-ID"]?.ToString();
        // Use correlationId for logging or tracing
        return Ok(new { CorrelationId = correlationId });
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

### Notes

- You can enhance the middleware to support logging frameworks by pushing the correlation ID into the logging context.
- Consider using a library like [AspNetCore.CorrelationId](https://github.com/stevejgordon/CorrelationId) for more advanced scenarios.

---

**Summary:**  
Implementing correlation IDs in .NET Core middleware involves creating a middleware that reads or generates a correlation ID, stores it in the request context, and adds it to the response headers. This enables end-to-end request tracing across distributed systems.

`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"5f4cb9f1-af83-4397-9d29-f33ada10c61c",question:"How can you implement middleware ordering dynamically at runtime?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
In .NET Core, middleware components are typically registered in the Startup class's \`Configure\` method, and their order is determined statically at application startup. However, if you need to implement middleware ordering dynamically at runtime—based on configuration, environment, or other factors—you can achieve this by building your middleware pipeline programmatically.

### Approach: Building the Middleware Pipeline Dynamically

Instead of registering middleware directly in \`Configure\`, you can:

1. Store your middleware registrations in a list or configuration.
2. Determine the order at runtime (e.g., from a database, config file, or user input).
3. Use \`IApplicationBuilder.Use\` to add middleware in the desired order.

#### Example

Suppose you have three middleware components: \`MiddlewareA\`, \`MiddlewareB\`, and \`MiddlewareC\`. You want to order them dynamically.

1. **Define Middleware Components:**

\`\`\`csharp
public class MiddlewareA
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    public MiddlewareA(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Logic for MiddlewareA
        await _next(context);
    }
}

// Similarly define MiddlewareB and MiddlewareC
\`\`\`

2. **Create a Mapping:**

\`\`\`csharp
var middlewareMap = new Dictionary<string, Func<IApplicationBuilder, IApplicationBuilder>>
{
    { "A", app => app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareA>() },
    { "B", app => app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareB>() },
    { "C", app => app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareC>() }
};
\`\`\`

3. **Determine the Order at Runtime:**

\`\`\`csharp
// This could come from a config file, database, etc.
string[] middlewareOrder = GetMiddlewareOrderFromConfig(); // e.g., ["B", "A", "C"]
\`\`\`

4. **Build the Pipeline Dynamically:**

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    foreach (var key in middlewareOrder)
    {
        if (middlewareMap.TryGetValue(key, out var useMiddleware))
        {
            app = useMiddleware(app);
        }
    }

    // Add terminal middleware (e.g., endpoints)
    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
    });
}
\`\`\`

### Notes

- The order in which you call \`UseMiddleware\` (or \`Use\`) determines the request pipeline order.
- This approach allows you to change the middleware order without recompiling your application.
- Be cautious with middleware dependencies; some middleware may require others to run before or after them.

Middleware in .NET Core is executed in the order it is added to the application pipeline. The sequence in which middleware components are registered has significant implications for both security and performance:

---

### Security Implications

- **Early Security Checks:** Security-related middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization, HTTPS redirection) should be placed early in the pipeline. This ensures that requests are validated and unauthorized or insecure requests are blocked before reaching sensitive endpoints or other middleware.
- **Short-circuiting:** If security middleware is placed after other components, potentially malicious requests could reach those components, increasing the attack surface.
- **Headers and CORS:** Middleware that sets security headers (e.g., HSTS, CORS) must be ordered before any middleware that might generate a response, to ensure headers are included in all responses.

**Example:**
\`\`\`csharp
app.UseHsts();
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
\`\`\`

---

### Performance Implications

- **Efficient Request Handling:** Middleware that can terminate requests early (e.g., static file serving, caching) should be placed before more expensive middleware. This avoids unnecessary processing for requests that can be handled quickly.
- **Resource Usage:** Placing logging or diagnostic middleware too early can increase overhead, especially if it processes all requests, including those that could be short-circuited.
- **Pipeline Length:** The more middleware a request passes through, the greater the processing time. Ordering middleware to minimize unnecessary processing improves overall performance.

**Example:**
\`\`\`csharp
app.UseStaticFiles(); // Handles static files and short-circuits the pipeline
app.UseRouting();
app.UseEndpoints(...);
\`\`\`

---

### Best Practices

- Place security middleware as early as possible.
- Place short-circuiting middleware (e.g., static files, caching) before others.
- Be mindful of dependencies between middleware (e.g., \`UseAuthentication\` before \`UseAuthorization\`).
- Regularly review middleware order as the application evolves.

---

**Summary Table**

| Middleware Type         | Recommended Order | Reason                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Security (Auth, HTTPS) | Early             | Block/validate requests ASAP              |
| Static Files/Caching   | Early             | Short-circuit unneeded processing         |
| Routing/Endpoints      | After security    | Ensure only valid requests are routed     |
| Error Handling         | Very early/late   | Catch errors from all downstream middleware|

---

**Conclusion:**  
Correct middleware ordering is critical for both securing your .NET Core application and optimizing its performance. Always consider the purpose and dependencies of each middleware when designing your pipeline.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"7bcf75c1-7b73-4c10-b640-b299b3c51c3d",question:"How do you implement middleware for request rate limiting?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To implement request rate limiting middleware in .NET Core, you can create a custom middleware that tracks requests per client (e.g., by IP address) and enforces limits. Here’s a step-by-step example:

### 1. Create the Rate Limiting Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
public class RateLimitingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<RateLimitingMiddleware> _logger;

    // Store request counts per IP
    private static readonly Dictionary<string, (int Count, DateTime WindowStart)> _requests = new();
    private static readonly object _lock = new();

    // Configuration
    private readonly int _maxRequests;
    private readonly TimeSpan _window;

    public RateLimitingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<RateLimitingMiddleware> logger, int maxRequests = 10, int windowSeconds = 60)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
        _maxRequests = maxRequests;
        _window = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(windowSeconds);
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var ipAddress = context.Connection.RemoteIpAddress?.ToString() ?? "unknown";

        bool isLimited = false;
        int retryAfter = 0;

        lock (_lock)
        {
            if (_requests.TryGetValue(ipAddress, out var entry))
            {
                if (DateTime.UtcNow - entry.WindowStart < _window)
                {
                    if (entry.Count >= _maxRequests)
                    {
                        isLimited = true;
                        retryAfter = (int)(_window - (DateTime.UtcNow - entry.WindowStart)).TotalSeconds;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        _requests[ipAddress] = (entry.Count + 1, entry.WindowStart);
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    // Reset window
                    _requests[ipAddress] = (1, DateTime.UtcNow);
                }
            }
            else
            {
                _requests[ipAddress] = (1, DateTime.UtcNow);
            }
        }

        if (isLimited)
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status429TooManyRequests;
            context.Response.Headers["Retry-After"] = retryAfter.ToString();
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.");
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Register the Middleware

In your \`Startup.cs\` or \`Program.cs\` (for .NET 6+):

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<RateLimitingMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

### 3. Notes

- This example uses an in-memory dictionary, which is suitable for demonstration or single-instance deployments. For distributed scenarios, use a distributed cache like Redis.
- You can enhance this middleware by customizing the key (e.g., API key, user ID), window size, and maximum requests.
- Consider using existing libraries like [AspNetCoreRateLimit](https://github.com/stefanprodan/AspNetCoreRateLimit) for production scenarios.

`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"c3b393da-d9fb-4093-ae2f-27cea83c2e8e",question:"How can you implement middleware for content negotiation?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To implement middleware for content negotiation in .NET Core, you need to inspect the \`Accept\` header of incoming HTTP requests and adjust the response format accordingly (e.g., JSON, XML). Below is an example of how you can create custom middleware for content negotiation:

### 1. Create the Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
public class ContentNegotiationMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ContentNegotiationMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Inspect the Accept header
        var acceptHeader = context.Request.Headers["Accept"].ToString();

        // Store the desired content type in the HttpContext for later use
        if (acceptHeader.Contains("application/xml"))
        {
            context.Items["ResponseContentType"] = "application/xml";
        }
        else
        {
            // Default to JSON
            context.Items["ResponseContentType"] = "application/json";
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Register the Middleware

In your \`Startup.cs\` (for .NET 6 and earlier) or \`Program.cs\` (for .NET 6+ minimal hosting):

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<ContentNegotiationMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

### 3. Use the Negotiated Content Type in Controllers

In your controller or endpoint, use the negotiated content type to format the response:

\`\`\`csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class SampleController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        var data = new { Message = "Hello, World!" };
        var contentType = HttpContext.Items["ResponseContentType"]?.ToString();

        if (contentType == "application/xml")
        {
            // Serialize to XML
            var xmlSerializer = new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(data.GetType());
            using var stringWriter = new StringWriter();
            xmlSerializer.Serialize(stringWriter, data);
            return Content(stringWriter.ToString(), "application/xml");
        }
        else
        {
            // Default to JSON
            return new JsonResult(data);
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Notes

- This is a simplified example. For production, consider supporting more content types and handling edge cases.
- ASP.NET Core MVC has built-in content negotiation, but this custom middleware is useful for APIs that need more control or for learning purposes.
- You can extend the middleware to support additional formats or custom logic.

`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"2dc135f8-7990-4a4a-8cff-a57d81327d0a",question:"How do you implement middleware that supports WebSockets?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To implement middleware that supports WebSockets in .NET Core, you need to:

1. **Add WebSocket support in your application.**
2. **Create custom middleware to handle WebSocket requests.**
3. **Process WebSocket connections and messages.**

Here’s a step-by-step guide with code examples:

---

### 1. Enable WebSockets in \`Startup.cs\`

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    var webSocketOptions = new WebSocketOptions()
    {
        KeepAliveInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(120),
        // AllowedOrigins = { "https://client.com" } // optional
    };

    app.UseWebSockets(webSocketOptions);

    app.UseMiddleware<WebSocketMiddleware>();

    // ... other middlewares
}
\`\`\`

---

### 2. Create the WebSocket Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
public class WebSocketMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public WebSocketMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (context.Request.Path == "/ws" && context.WebSockets.IsWebSocketRequest)
        {
            using (WebSocket webSocket = await context.WebSockets.AcceptWebSocketAsync())
            {
                await HandleWebSocketAsync(context, webSocket);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            await _next(context);
        }
    }

    private async Task HandleWebSocketAsync(HttpContext context, WebSocket webSocket)
    {
        var buffer = new byte[1024 * 4];
        WebSocketReceiveResult result = await webSocket.ReceiveAsync(
            new ArraySegment<byte>(buffer), CancellationToken.None);

        while (!result.CloseStatus.HasValue)
        {
            // Echo the message back to the client
            await webSocket.SendAsync(
                new ArraySegment<byte>(buffer, 0, result.Count),
                result.MessageType,
                result.EndOfMessage,
                CancellationToken.None);

            result = await webSocket.ReceiveAsync(
                new ArraySegment<byte>(buffer), CancellationToken.None);
        }

        await webSocket.CloseAsync(
            result.CloseStatus.Value, result.CloseStatusDescription, CancellationToken.None);
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

### 3. Register the Middleware

Make sure you register \`app.UseWebSockets()\` **before** your custom middleware.

---

### 4. Usage

Clients can now connect to \`ws://<host>/ws\` and the server will echo messages back.

---

## Key Points

- Use \`app.UseWebSockets()\` to enable WebSocket support.
- Check \`context.WebSockets.IsWebSocketRequest\` to determine if the request is a WebSocket handshake.
- Accept the WebSocket connection with \`AcceptWebSocketAsync()\`.
- Handle message receiving and sending in a loop until the connection is closed.
- Always close the WebSocket gracefully.

---

**References:**
- [ASP.NET Core Middleware Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/)
- [WebSockets in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/websockets)`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"cd8cc216-8539-4c16-9fa8-ef2961062fbb",question:"How do you handle middleware exceptions that occur after the response has started?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Handling exceptions in .NET Core middleware after the response has started is challenging because once the HTTP response headers are sent, you cannot change the status code or add new headers. Here’s how you can approach this scenario:

### Key Points

- **Before response starts:** You can catch exceptions, set status codes, and write custom error messages.
- **After response starts:** The response headers are already sent, so you cannot change status codes or headers. You can only write to the response body.

### Strategies

#### 1. Exception Handling Middleware Placement

Place your exception handling middleware as early as possible in the pipeline to catch exceptions before the response starts.

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>();
    // Other middlewares
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Check \`HttpResponse.HasStarted\`

In your middleware, check if the response has started before attempting to modify headers or status codes.

\`\`\`csharp
if (!context.Response.HasStarted)
{
    context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
    // Write error response
}
else
{
    // Log the error, as you can't change headers/status code
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Logging and Graceful Degradation

If the response has started, the best you can do is:

- Log the exception for diagnostics.
- Optionally write a minimal error message to the response body (if appropriate).
- Avoid throwing further exceptions to prevent connection resets.

\`\`\`csharp
try
{
    await _next(context);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    if (!context.Response.HasStarted)
    {
        context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("An error occurred.");
    }
    else
    {
        // Log the exception
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Exception after response started.");
        // Optionally write to the response body
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("\\nAn internal error occurred.");
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 4. Design Considerations

- **Minimize work after response starts:** Try to perform all critical operations before writing to the response.
- **Buffer output if possible:** Use buffering (e.g., \`UseResponseBuffering\`) to delay sending headers until you’re sure no exceptions will occur.

### Summary Table

| Scenario                          | Can set status code/headers? | Can write to body? | Recommendation                    |
|------------------------------------|:----------------------------:|:-----------------:|-----------------------------------|
| Before response starts             | Yes                          | Yes               | Set status, write error response  |
| After response has started         | No                           | Yes               | Log, write minimal error message  |

---

**In summary:**  
Once the response has started, you cannot change headers or status codes. Handle exceptions as early as possible, log errors, and only write to the response body if necessary. Design your middleware to minimize exceptions after the response has begun.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"38029704-f592-41a2-9ddc-cfd4fd6a0355",question:"How can you implement middleware for API versioning?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To implement middleware for API versioning in .NET Core, you can create custom middleware that inspects incoming requests for version information (e.g., from headers, query strings, or URL segments) and sets the version context accordingly. While ASP.NET Core provides built-in API versioning via the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning package, creating custom middleware gives you more control over how versioning is handled.

### Example: Custom Middleware for API Versioning

#### 1. Create the Middleware

\`\`\`csharp
public class ApiVersioningMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public ApiVersioningMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Example: Read version from "x-api-version" header
        if (context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue("x-api-version", out var version))
        {
            // Store the version in HttpContext.Items for later use
            context.Items["ApiVersion"] = version.ToString();
        }
        else
        {
            // Default version if not specified
            context.Items["ApiVersion"] = "1.0";
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Register the Middleware

In your \`Startup.cs\` or \`Program.cs\` (depending on .NET Core version):

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<ApiVersioningMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

#### 3. Use the Version in Controllers

You can access the version in your controllers or action filters:

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        var version = HttpContext.Items["ApiVersion"]?.ToString();
        // Use the version to control logic
        return Ok(new { Version = version });
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 4. Advanced: Route Based on Version

You can further enhance the middleware to rewrite the request path based on the version or use endpoint routing to map different controllers for different versions.

---

### Notes

- For production scenarios, consider using the official [ASP.NET API Versioning library](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet-api-versioning) for robust features.
- Custom middleware is useful for non-standard versioning schemes or when you need to integrate versioning with other custom logic.

---

**Summary:**  
Implementing API versioning middleware in .NET Core involves creating a middleware component that extracts version information from requests and makes it available for downstream processing, enabling you to control API behavior based on the requested version.

`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"a91da435-c19b-4351-9871-0ef8dd18508e",question:"How do you implement middleware for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To implement middleware for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in .NET Core, you typically use the built-in CORS middleware provided by Microsoft. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Add the CORS Services

In your \`Startup.cs\` (for .NET Core 3.1/5) or \`Program.cs\` (for .NET 6+), add the CORS services in the service configuration section:

\`\`\`csharp
// For .NET 6+ (Program.cs)
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AllowSpecificOrigin",
        policy =>
        {
            policy.WithOrigins("https://example.com")
                  .AllowAnyHeader()
                  .AllowAnyMethod();
        });
});
\`\`\`

### 2. Use the CORS Middleware

Add the CORS middleware to the HTTP request pipeline. This should be placed before any middleware that handles requests (like \`UseAuthorization\` or \`UseEndpoints\`):

\`\`\`csharp
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseCors("AllowSpecificOrigin");

// ... other middleware (e.g., app.UseAuthorization())

app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
\`\`\`

### 3. (Optional) Apply CORS Policy to Specific Controllers or Actions

You can also apply the CORS policy to specific controllers or actions using the \`[EnableCors]\` attribute:

\`\`\`csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
[EnableCors("AllowSpecificOrigin")]
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    // Actions here
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Custom Middleware (Advanced)

If you need more control, you can implement your own CORS middleware by creating a custom middleware class:

\`\`\`csharp
public class CustomCorsMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomCorsMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.Headers.Add("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://example.com");
        context.Response.Headers.Add("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE");
        context.Response.Headers.Add("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type");

        // Handle preflight requests
        if (context.Request.Method == "OPTIONS")
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 204;
            return;
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}
\`\`\`

Register your custom middleware in the pipeline:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<CustomCorsMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

> **Note:** It's recommended to use the built-in CORS middleware for most scenarios, as it handles edge cases and security concerns.

    {
        options.EnableForHttps = true; // Optional: Enable for HTTPS
        options.Providers.Add<GzipCompressionProvider>();
        // You can add BrotliCompressionProvider as well
    });

    services.Configure<GzipCompressionProviderOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.Level = System.IO.Compression.CompressionLevel.Fastest;
    });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseResponseCompression();

    // Other middleware registrations
}
\`\`\`

## 2. Request Decompression (Custom Middleware)

.NET Core does not provide built-in request decompression. You need to implement custom middleware to handle compressed request bodies.

**Example: Custom Gzip Request Decompression Middleware**

\`\`\`csharp
public class RequestDecompressionMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public RequestDecompressionMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        if (context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue("Content-Encoding", out var encoding) &&
            encoding.ToString().Contains("gzip", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        {
            var originalBodyStream = context.Request.Body;
            using (var decompressedStream = new System.IO.Compression.GZipStream(
                context.Request.Body, System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode.Decompress, leaveOpen: true))
            {
                var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
                await decompressedStream.CopyToAsync(memoryStream);
                memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
                context.Request.Body = memoryStream;

                await _next(context);

                context.Request.Body = originalBodyStream;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            await _next(context);
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Register the middleware:**

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<RequestDecompressionMiddleware>();
    app.UseResponseCompression();
    // Other middleware
}
\`\`\`

## 3. Summary

- Use \`app.UseResponseCompression()\` for response compression.
- Implement and register custom middleware for request decompression.
- Ensure the order of middleware is correct: decompress requests before reading the body, and compress responses after generating them.

To implement middleware for authentication and authorization in .NET Core, you typically use the built-in middleware components provided by the framework. However, you can also create custom middleware if you need more control or custom logic.

## 1. Using Built-in Middleware

### Authentication Middleware

Add authentication services in \`Startup.cs\` (or \`Program.cs\` in .NET 6+):

\`\`\`csharp
// In Program.cs (.NET 6+)
builder.Services.AddAuthentication("MyScheme")
    .AddCookie("MyScheme", options => {
        options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
    });
\`\`\`

Add the authentication middleware to the pipeline:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseAuthentication();
\`\`\`

### Authorization Middleware

Add authorization services:

\`\`\`csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options => {
    options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
});
\`\`\`

Add the authorization middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseAuthorization();
\`\`\`

Apply authorization policies to controllers or actions:

\`\`\`csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]
public IActionResult AdminAction() { ... }
\`\`\`

## 2. Custom Middleware Example

If you need custom logic, you can create your own middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
public class CustomAuthMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomAuthMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Example: Check for a custom header or token
        var token = context.Request.Headers["X-Custom-Token"].FirstOrDefault();
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(token) || !IsValidToken(token))
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized;
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Unauthorized");
            return;
        }

        // Optionally set user identity
        var claims = new[] { new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "CustomUser") };
        var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, "Custom");
        context.User = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);

        await _next(context);
    }

    private bool IsValidToken(string token)
    {
        // Implement your token validation logic here
        return token == "expected-token";
    }
}
\`\`\`

Register your custom middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<CustomAuthMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

## 3. Middleware Order

Order is important:
1. \`UseAuthentication()\`
2. \`UseAuthorization()\`
3. Your endpoints (e.g., \`MapControllers()\`)

Example:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();
\`\`\`

## Summary

- Use built-in \`UseAuthentication\` and \`UseAuthorization\` for standard scenarios.
- Create custom middleware for advanced or non-standard authentication/authorization logic.
- Always consider middleware order in the pipeline.

`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"8568afcf-5d4d-47c6-98fd-22c552b8ca8b",question:"How can you debug middleware execution order and behavior?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
To debug middleware execution order and behavior in .NET Core, you can use several techniques:

### 1. Logging Middleware Entry and Exit

Insert logging statements at the start and end of each middleware to trace the execution flow:

\`\`\`csharp
public class DebugMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<DebugMiddleware> _logger;

    public DebugMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<DebugMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Entering DebugMiddleware");
        await _next(context);
        _logger.LogInformation("Exiting DebugMiddleware");
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Use the Developer Exception Page

Add \`app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\` early in your pipeline during development to get detailed error information and stack traces.

### 3. Breakpoints and Debugger

- Set breakpoints inside the \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` methods of your middleware.
- Use the debugger to step through the middleware pipeline and observe the order of execution and the state of \`HttpContext\`.

### 4. Analyze Middleware Registration Order

Middleware executes in the order they are registered in \`Startup.cs\` (\`Configure\` method). Double-check the order to ensure it matches your expectations.

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<FirstMiddleware>();
app.UseMiddleware<SecondMiddleware>();
app.UseMiddleware<ThirdMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

### 5. Custom Diagnostic Middleware

You can create a diagnostic middleware that logs the current state of the request or response at various points in the pipeline.

\`\`\`csharp
public class DiagnosticMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    public DiagnosticMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Before: {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
        Console.WriteLine($"After: {context.Response.StatusCode}");
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 6. Use Middleware Analysis Tools

- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.MiddlewareAnalysis**: Add this NuGet package and call \`app.UseMiddlewareAnalysis();\` to log middleware execution events to the output window.

### 7. Inspect HTTP Response Headers

Some middleware (like CORS or authentication) may add headers. Inspecting these can help determine if/when middleware has executed.
