Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple data models, making it a multi-model database service. The supported data models are:

- **Document** (e.g., JSON documents)
- **Key-Value**
- **Graph** (e.g., Gremlin)
- **Column-Family** (e.g., Cassandra)
- **Table** (similar to Azure Table storage)

This flexibility allows you to use Azure Cosmos DB for a wide range of applications and workloads.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113830Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"6a02f7fe-4d66-46d4-954d-03f79810a899",question:"What is a container in Azure Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown A **container** in Azure Cosmos DB is a schema-agnostic collection of items, similar to a table in relational databases or a collection in MongoDB. Each container can store JSON documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or column-family data, depending on the chosen API. Containers are the fundamental unit of scalability and distribution in Cosmos DB—they automatically partition data and scale throughput and storage as needed.

**Key points:**
- Containers hold your data (items/documents).
- They are automatically partitioned for scalability.
- Each container is associated with a specific throughput (RU/s).
- You can query, insert, update, and delete items within a container.

**Example:**  
If you’re storing user profiles, you might have a container called \`Users\` where each item is a user’s profile document.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113839Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"84a0ae68-d6fe-4cf2-9ad6-1a571d25fb91",question:"What is the difference between a database and a container in Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

In Azure Cosmos DB:

- **Database**: This is a logical container for organizing one or more containers. It acts as a namespace and provides a way to group related containers together. Think of it as a folder that holds your data collections.

- **Container**: This is where your actual data is stored. A container can be a collection (for SQL API), a table (for Table API), or a graph (for Gremlin API). Containers hold items (documents, rows, or nodes/edges) and are the main unit of scalability and performance in Cosmos DB.

**Summary Table:**

| Concept   | Description                                   | Example (SQL API)         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Database  | Logical grouping of containers                | \`MyDatabase\`              |
| Container | Stores data items (documents, rows, etc.)     | \`Users\`, \`Orders\`         |

**Key Point:**  
A database can have multiple containers, but a container is where your data actually lives and is managed/scaled.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113902Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"34f8975d-4a1c-4151-ad56-c6403f807714",question:"How does Azure Cosmos DB ensure high availability?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Azure Cosmos DB ensures high availability through several key features:

1. **Global Distribution**  
   Cosmos DB allows you to replicate your data across any number of Azure regions. This means your data is available close to your users, reducing latency and ensuring availability even if one region goes down.

2. **Multi-region Writes**  
   You can enable multi-region writes, allowing your application to write data to any region. This increases availability and provides seamless failover capabilities.

3. **Automatic Failover**  
   In case of a regional outage, Cosmos DB automatically fails over to another available region with minimal downtime, ensuring your application remains available.

4. **99.999% SLA**  
   Microsoft offers a financially backed SLA of 99.999% for read and write availability for Cosmos DB accounts configured with multi-region writes.

5. **Data Replication**  
   Cosmos DB uses automatic and synchronous data replication within a region, and asynchronous replication across regions, to protect against hardware failures.

6. **Partitioning and Redundancy**  
   Data is partitioned and stored redundantly across multiple physical partitions, further protecting against failures.

**In summary:**  
Azure Cosmos DB ensures high availability by replicating data across multiple regions, supporting multi-region writes, providing automatic failover, and maintaining redundant copies of your data, all backed by a strong SLA.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113847Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"f2634acf-ed68-48b1-b10b-22d2f20a3eb8",question:"What are the different APIs supported by Azure Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple APIs to allow developers to use the database with different data models and programming paradigms. The main APIs supported by Azure Cosmos DB are:

- **SQL API**: For querying JSON documents using SQL-like syntax. This is the default and most commonly used API.
- **MongoDB API**: Allows applications to interact with Cosmos DB as if it were a MongoDB database.
- **Cassandra API**: Enables the use of Cassandra SDKs and tools to work with Cosmos DB.
- **Gremlin API**: Supports graph-based data and allows you to use the Gremlin query language for traversing graphs.
- **Table API**: Provides key-value storage and is compatible with Azure Table storage.

These APIs make Azure Cosmos DB a multi-model database service, enabling you to choose the API that best fits your application's needs.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113855Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"9e0665d7-9de0-4d53-a246-3b420f27b845",question:"What is a partition key in Azure Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

A **partition key** in Azure Cosmos DB is a property (or field) in your data that is used to distribute your data across multiple physical partitions for scalability and performance. When you create a container (such as a collection or table), you choose a partition key. Cosmos DB uses the value of this key in each item to decide where to store the item.

**Key points:**
- The partition key helps Cosmos DB scale out and manage large amounts of data efficiently.
- All items with the same partition key value are stored together.
- Choosing a good partition key is important for performance and cost.

**Example:**  
If you have a collection of user profiles, you might use \`/userId\` as the partition key, so all data for the same user is stored together.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113864Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"8d2ae508-3f1e-4755-a86f-3fae98246edb",question:"How is data distributed in Azure Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

In Azure Cosmos DB, data is distributed using a concept called **partitioning**. When you create a container (such as a collection or table), you choose a **partition key**. This key is a property in your data that Cosmos DB uses to divide your data into multiple logical partitions.

Each partition contains a subset of your data, and Cosmos DB automatically manages these partitions across multiple physical servers. This allows Cosmos DB to scale out and handle large amounts of data and high request rates efficiently.

**Key points:**
- Data is distributed based on the value of the partition key.
- Items with the same partition key value are stored together.
- Cosmos DB automatically balances and manages partitions as your data grows.

**Example:**
If you have a collection of user profiles and choose \`userId\` as the partition key, all data for the same user will be stored together in the same partition.

**Benefits:**
- Enables horizontal scaling.
- Improves performance and availability.
- Simplifies management of large datasets.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.113873Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"b764c230-9c8d-48cd-b891-57b29345856e",question:"What is Request Unit (RU) in Azure Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Request Unit (RU) in Azure Cosmos DB**

A **Request Unit (RU)** is the currency for throughput in Azure Cosmos DB. It is a normalized measure that abstracts the system resources (CPU, memory, IOPS) required to perform database operations such as reads, writes, and queries.

- **1 RU** is the cost to read a 1 KB item by its ID.
- Every operation (read, write, update, delete, query) consumes a certain number of RUs based on its complexity and the size of the data.
- You can provision the number of RUs per second for your database or container, ensuring predictable performance.

**Key Points:**
- RUs help you estimate and control the cost and performance of your Cosmos DB workload.
- If your workload exceeds the provisioned RU/s, requests may be throttled until more RUs are available.

**Example:**  
Reading a small document might cost 1 RU, while a complex query or a large write operation could cost many more RUs.

Azure Cosmos DB is designed for global distribution from the ground up. Here’s how it manages global distribution:

1. **Multi-Region Replication**  
   Cosmos DB allows you to associate your database with any number of Azure regions. Data is automatically replicated across all selected regions.

2. **Multi-Master Support**  
   You can enable multi-region writes, allowing applications to write data to any region. Cosmos DB handles conflict resolution automatically.

3. **Automatic Failover**  
   In the event of a regional outage, Cosmos DB automatically fails over to another region to maintain availability.

4. **Consistency Models**  
   Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels (Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, Eventual) so you can balance performance and data consistency according to your needs.

5. **Low Latency**  
   By replicating data close to your users, Cosmos DB ensures low read and write latency globally.

6. **Transparent Data Distribution**  
   All data distribution and replication are managed by Cosmos DB, so developers don’t need to handle sharding or replication logic.

These are:

1. **Strong Consistency**
   - Guarantees linearizability. Reads always return the most recent committed write.
   - Equivalent to a single, up-to-date copy of the data.

2. **Bounded Staleness**
   - Guarantees that reads are never older than a specified number of versions (\`K\`) or time interval (\`T\`).
   - Provides a predictable lag between writes and reads.

3. **Session Consistency**
   - Guarantees consistency within a single client session.
   - Reads within a session always reflect the writes made by that session.

4. **Consistent Prefix**
   - Guarantees that reads never see out-of-order writes.
   - If a sequence of writes is made, reads will see them in the same order.

5. **Eventual Consistency**
   - Offers the weakest consistency.
   - No ordering guarantees; reads may return stale data, but eventually all replicas converge.

Azure Cosmos DB allows you to scale throughput to meet the needs of your application. Throughput is measured in **Request Units per second (RU/s)**. There are two main ways to scale throughput:

#### 1. **Manually Provisioned Throughput**
- **At the Container Level:** You can assign a specific RU/s value to an individual container (e.g., a collection or table).
- **At the Database Level (Shared Throughput):** You can provision throughput at the database level, and all containers within that database share the allocated RU/s.

**How to scale:**
- Use the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or SDKs to increase or decrease the RU/s value as needed.
- Changes take effect almost instantly.

#### 2. **Autoscale Throughput**
- Cosmos DB offers **autoscale** (formerly called "autopilot") throughput, where you specify a maximum RU/s, and Cosmos DB automatically scales the throughput between 10% and 100% of the maximum based on your workload.
- This is useful for workloads with unpredictable or variable traffic.

**How to enable:**
- When creating a new container or database, select the autoscale option and specify the maximum RU/s.
- You can also convert existing resources to autoscale.

#### 3. **Global Distribution**
- If your Cosmos DB account is globally distributed, throughput can be scaled independently in each region to ensure low-latency access and high availability.

**Summary Table:**

| Scaling Method         | Description                                  | Use Case                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Manual Provisioning   | Set RU/s manually at container or DB level   | Predictable workloads           |
| Autoscale             | RU/s automatically scales with demand        | Variable or unpredictable loads |

1. **Automatic Replication**  
   Every piece of data written to Cosmos DB is automatically replicated across multiple physical partitions within a region. By default, Cosmos DB maintains four replicas of your data within each region.

2. **Quorum-based Writes**  
   When a write operation occurs, Cosmos DB uses a quorum-based protocol. A write is only acknowledged as successful after a majority of replicas confirm the write, ensuring that data is not lost even if some replicas fail.

3. **Multi-region Replication**  
   For additional durability, Cosmos DB can be configured to replicate data across multiple Azure regions. This protects against regional outages and enables geo-redundancy.

4. **Automatic Failover**  
   In the event of hardware or regional failures, Cosmos DB automatically fails over to healthy replicas or regions, ensuring continuous data availability and durability.

5. **Write-ahead Logging**  
   Cosmos DB uses write-ahead logging to persist changes before they are applied, further protecting against data loss in case of unexpected failures.

TTL (Time to Live) is a feature in Azure Cosmos DB that automatically deletes items (documents) from a container after a specified period of time. This helps manage storage costs and ensures that outdated or irrelevant data is removed without manual intervention.

### How TTL Works

- **Enabling TTL:** TTL can be enabled at the container level. Once enabled, you can specify a default expiration period (in seconds) for all items in the container.
- **Per-Item TTL:** You can override the container-level TTL by setting a specific TTL value on individual items using the \`ttl\` property.
- **Automatic Deletion:** When an item’s TTL expires, Cosmos DB automatically and asynchronously deletes the item from the container.
- **Disabling TTL:** Setting the TTL value to \`-1\` disables automatic deletion for the container or item.

### Use Cases

- **Session management:** Automatically remove expired user sessions.
- **Cache scenarios:** Store temporary data that should expire after a certain period.
- **Compliance:** Ensure sensitive data is deleted after a retention period.

### Example

\`\`\`json
{
  "id": "item1",
  "name": "example",
  "ttl": 3600  // This item will expire in 1 hour (3600 seconds)
}
\`\`\`

### Key Points

- TTL helps automate data lifecycle management.
- It reduces manual cleanup and storage costs.
- TTL is non-blocking and deletion is handled asynchronously.

Azure Cosmos DB provides automated and manual backup options to help protect your data.

#### 1. **Automatic Backups**
- **Automatic Backups**: Cosmos DB automatically takes periodic backups of your data at regular intervals (every 4 hours by default).
- **Retention**: These backups are retained for 7 days (configurable up to 30 days for some accounts).
- **Geo-Redundancy**: Backups are stored in a regionally redundant storage, ensuring data durability.

#### 2. **Manual Backups**
- **On-Demand Backups**: You can trigger manual (on-demand) backups through the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or REST API.
- **Long-Term Retention**: Manual backups can be retained for up to 30 days, regardless of the automatic backup retention policy.

#### 3. **Restore Operations**
- **Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)**: For accounts with PITR enabled, you can restore your data to any point within the retention window.
- **Restore Process**:
  1. **Initiate Restore**: Use the Azure Portal, CLI, or REST API to initiate a restore operation.
  2. **New Account**: The restore operation creates a new Cosmos DB account with the restored data.
  3. **Data Access**: Once the restore is complete, you can access your data from the new account and migrate it as needed.

#### 4. **Limitations**
- **Granularity**: Restores are performed at the account level, not at the container or database level.
- **No In-Place Restore**: You cannot overwrite an existing account; restores always create a new account.

#### 5. **Best Practices**
- **Enable PITR**: For mission-critical workloads, enable Point-in-Time Restore.
- **Monitor Backups**: Regularly review backup and restore settings to ensure compliance with your data protection policies.
- **Test Restores**: Periodically test restore operations to validate your backup strategy.

**Summary:**  
Azure Cosmos DB handles backups automatically and allows manual backups. Restores are performed by creating a new account from a backup, with options for point-in-time restore if enabled. Always review your backup settings and test restores to ensure data safety.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114003Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"3c5eac92-271a-476c-a153-68742b17f02b",question:"What is indexing in Cosmos DB and how does it work?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB**

Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB is the process of automatically creating and maintaining indexes on data stored within a container. This enables efficient and fast query performance without requiring manual index management.

### How Indexing Works in Cosmos DB

- **Automatic Indexing:** By default, Cosmos DB automatically indexes all properties of items in a container, regardless of their structure. This means you can query any property without pre-defining indexes.
- **Indexing Policy:** You can customize the indexing behavior using an indexing policy. This allows you to:
  - Include or exclude specific paths (properties) from being indexed.
  - Choose between consistent, lazy, or no indexing modes.
  - Specify index types (e.g., range, spatial, composite).
- **Types of Indexes:**
  - **Range Indexes:** Support efficient queries on numeric, string, and date values.
  - **Spatial Indexes:** Enable efficient queries on geospatial data.
  - **Composite Indexes:** Optimize performance for queries involving multiple properties.

### Benefits

- **Performance:** Indexing ensures queries are served quickly, typically in milliseconds, regardless of the data size.
- **Flexibility:** No need to manage or update indexes manually as your data model evolves.
- **Cost Efficiency:** You can exclude rarely queried properties from indexing to save on storage and throughput.

### Example

\`\`\`json
{
  "indexingMode": "consistent",
  "includedPaths": [
    { "path": "/*" }
  ],
  "excludedPaths": [
    { "path": "/nonIndexedProperty/?" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

This policy indexes all properties except \`nonIndexedProperty\`.

**Summary:**  
Indexing in Cosmos DB is automatic and customizable, enabling fast and flexible queries on your data while minimizing manual management.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114011Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"9cfba102-410a-4d3a-9b21-872de84ac645",question:"How do you optimize query performance in Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown To optimize query performance in Azure Cosmos DB, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Design Efficient Data Models**
- **Denormalize Data:** Store related data together to minimize the number of queries.
- **Choose the Right Partition Key:** Select a partition key that evenly distributes data and query load.

### 2. **Indexing**
- **Customize Indexing Policies:** Exclude properties that are not queried to reduce index size and improve write performance.
- **Use Composite Indexes:** For queries with multiple properties in filters or order by clauses, define composite indexes.

### 3. **Query Optimization**
- **Use Projections:** Retrieve only required fields using \`SELECT VALUE\` or specifying property names.
- **Avoid Cross-Partition Queries:** Where possible, target specific partitions using the partition key.
- **Use Efficient Predicates:** Write queries that leverage indexed properties and avoid full scans.

### 4. **Throughput Management**
- **Provision Adequate RU/s:** Ensure your container has enough Request Units per second (RU/s) for peak workloads.
- **Monitor RU Consumption:** Use Azure Monitor to track and adjust throughput as needed.

### 5. **Pagination and Continuation Tokens**
- **Implement Pagination:** Use continuation tokens to fetch large result sets in smaller, manageable chunks.

### 6. **SDK and API Best Practices**
- **Use Latest SDKs:** Benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
- **Batch Operations:** Where possible, use bulk or batch operations to reduce network overhead.

### 7. **Monitoring and Diagnostics**

Selecting an effective partition key is crucial for performance, scalability, and cost efficiency in Azure Cosmos DB. Here are the best practices:

---

### 1. **Ensure High Cardinality**
- **Choose a property with many unique values.**
- This ensures data is distributed evenly across partitions, preventing "hot" partitions and bottlenecks.

### 2. **Distribute Workload Evenly**
- The partition key should spread both storage and request throughput (RU/s) evenly.
- Avoid keys that result in most operations targeting a single partition.

### 3. **Consider Query Patterns**
- Select a key that aligns with your most common queries.
- If you frequently query by a certain property, consider using it as the partition key to avoid cross-partition queries.

### 4. **Avoid Large Items in One Partition**
- No single logical partition (all items with the same partition key value) can exceed 20 GB.
- Ensure your partition key choice won’t lead to oversized partitions.

### 5. **Immutable Partition Key Value**
- Once set, the partition key value for an item cannot be changed.
- Choose a property that will not change over the item's lifetime.

### 6. **Composite Keys for Better Distribution**
- If a single property doesn’t provide enough uniqueness, consider concatenating multiple properties.

### 7. **Don’t Use Frequently Updated Properties**
- Avoid properties that are updated often, as this can complicate data management.

### 8. **Review and Test**
- Use Azure’s **Partition Key Advisor** and monitor partition metrics after deployment.
- Adjust if you observe uneven distribution or performance issues.

Choosing the right partition key is a critical design decision—plan ahead and test with realistic workloads!`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114027Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"f46751d7-6ef9-4056-adc3-a9720c08b0f3",question:"How does Cosmos DB handle conflicts in multi-master replication?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
### How Cosmos DB Handles Conflicts in Multi-Master Replication

Azure Cosmos DB supports **multi-master replication**, allowing writes to be made in any region. This introduces the possibility of **conflicts** when the same item is modified concurrently in different regions. Cosmos DB provides robust conflict resolution mechanisms to handle such scenarios:

#### 1. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**

Cosmos DB offers two built-in conflict resolution policies:

- **Last Write Wins (LWW):**
  - By default, Cosmos DB uses the Last Write Wins policy.
  - Each document has a system-defined property called \`_ts\` (timestamp) or a user-defined property (if specified).
  - When a conflict occurs, the version with the highest value for the conflict resolution property (e.g., latest timestamp) is chosen as the winner.
  - This approach is simple and efficient but may result in lost updates if not carefully managed.

- **Custom Conflict Resolution (User-Defined):**
  - You can specify a custom property (e.g., \`version\`, \`updatedAt\`) for conflict resolution instead of the default \`_ts\`.
  - This allows more control over how conflicts are resolved, such as using application-specific logic.

#### 2. **Manual Conflict Resolution**

- If you require more granular control, Cosmos DB allows you to **access and resolve conflicts manually**.
- Conflicting items are stored in a special **conflicts feed**.
- Your application can read from this feed and apply custom logic to resolve conflicts (e.g., merging changes, prompting users, etc.).
- Once resolved, you can update the item in the container and remove the conflict from the feed.

#### 3. **Conflict Detection**

- Conflicts are detected at the item (document) level, based on the item's unique ID.
- When two or more regions write to the same item concurrently, Cosmos DB detects the conflict during replication.

#### 4. **Conflict Resolution Workflow**

1. **Write operations** occur in multiple regions.
2. **Replication** synchronizes changes across regions.
3. If the same item is updated in different regions before replication, a **conflict** is detected.
4. Cosmos DB applies the configured **conflict resolution policy** (LWW or custom).
5. Optionally, unresolved conflicts are exposed in the **conflicts feed** for manual resolution.

#### 5. **Best Practices**

- Choose the conflict resolution policy that best fits your application's consistency and business requirements.
- Use manual conflict resolution for complex scenarios where automatic policies are insufficient.
- Monitor the conflicts feed to detect and resolve conflicts proactively.

Here’s a detailed explanation of its role:

---

## Role of the Change Feed in Cosmos DB

- **Real-Time Data Processing:**  
  The Change Feed provides a persistent, ordered log of changes (inserts and updates) to items in a Cosmos DB container. Applications can read from the Change Feed to process these changes as they occur.

- **Event-Driven Architectures:**  
  It enables event-driven scenarios, such as triggering downstream processes, updating materialized views, or integrating with other services (e.g., Azure Functions, Azure Stream Analytics).

- **Incremental Data Movement:**  
  The Change Feed can be used to incrementally move or sync data to other storage systems or services, supporting ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.

- **Auditing and Monitoring:**  
  By capturing all changes, the Change Feed can be used for auditing, monitoring, and implementing custom business logic based on data modifications.

- **Scalability and Reliability:**  
  The Change Feed is highly scalable and reliable, leveraging Cosmos DB’s global distribution and multi-region replication.

---

### How It Works

- The Change Feed is available per logical partition key within a container.
- It provides a sorted list of changes, guaranteeing that all changes are delivered in order per partition.
- Consumers can resume reading from a specific point, enabling checkpointing and fault tolerance.

---

### Example Use Cases

- **Real-time analytics:** Calculating aggregates or updating dashboards as data changes.
- **Notifications:** Sending alerts or emails when specific data changes occur.
- **Data synchronization:** Keeping caches or secondary databases in sync with Cosmos DB.

---

**In summary:**  
The Change Feed in Cosmos DB is essential for building reactive, scalable, and real-time applications by providing a reliable mechanism to observe and act upon data changes as they happen.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114042Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"2ce0274e-7a49-43cc-b43e-3cd71a5170ac",question:"How can you implement custom conflict resolution in Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
### Implementing Custom Conflict Resolution in Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB supports multi-master replication, which can lead to conflicts when the same document is updated concurrently in different regions. By default, Cosmos DB provides built-in conflict resolution policies (Last Writer Wins and custom stored procedures). To implement **custom conflict resolution**, follow these steps:

#### 1. Enable Multi-Master and Set Conflict Resolution Policy

- When creating a Cosmos DB container, set the **conflict resolution policy** to \`Custom\`.
- This policy requires you to specify a stored procedure that will be invoked to resolve conflicts.

#### 2. Write a Conflict Resolution Stored Procedure

- The stored procedure must accept two parameters:
  - \`conflicts\`: An array of conflicting documents.
  - \`context\`: The context object for the operation.
- The stored procedure should contain logic to resolve the conflict (e.g., merge fields, select based on custom logic).

**Example:**
\`\`\`javascript
function resolveConflicts(conflicts, context) {
    // Example: Prefer document with highest 'version' property
    let winner = conflicts[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < conflicts.length; i++) {
        if (conflicts[i].version > winner.version) {
            winner = conflicts[i];
        }
    }
    // Replace the conflicting document with the winner
    var collection = context.getCollection();
    var accepted = collection.replaceDocument(winner._self, winner, function(err) {
        if (err) throw err;
    });
    if (!accepted) throw new Error("Failed to resolve conflict.");
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Register the Stored Procedure

- Deploy the stored procedure to your Cosmos DB container using the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or SDK.

#### 4. Configure the Container to Use the Stored Procedure

- When creating or updating the container, set the \`conflictResolutionPolicy\` to reference your stored procedure:

\`\`\`json
{
  "conflictResolutionPolicy": {
    "mode": "Custom",
    "conflictResolutionProcedure": "dbs/<db>/colls/<coll>/sprocs/<sprocName>"
  }
}
\`\`\`

#### 5. Monitor and Test

- Test your conflict resolution logic by simulating concurrent writes.
- Monitor the \`conflicts\` feed to ensure conflicts are being resolved as expected.

Azure Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels, each with distinct trade-offs between **latency**, **throughput**, and **data consistency**:

#### 1. Strong Consistency
- **Latency:** Highest latency, especially for globally distributed applications, because reads must wait for data to be committed across all replicas.
- **Throughput:** Lower throughput due to coordination overhead.
- **Implication:** Guarantees linearizability but at the cost of performance.

#### 2. Bounded Staleness
- **Latency:** Lower than strong consistency, but higher than session or eventual. Reads may be delayed up to the configured staleness window.
- **Throughput:** Higher than strong, but still limited by the need to track staleness.
- **Implication:** Offers predictable consistency with moderate performance impact.

#### 3. Session Consistency
- **Latency:** Low latency for operations within the same session.
- **Throughput:** High throughput, as reads are served from the nearest replica for the session.
- **Implication:** Ideal for user-centric applications; balances consistency and performance.

#### 4. Consistent Prefix
- **Latency:** Comparable to session consistency; low latency as long as reads are from the nearest replica.
- **Throughput:** High throughput.
- **Implication:** Ensures order of writes is preserved, suitable for scenarios where order matters but strict consistency is not required.

#### 5. Eventual Consistency
- **Latency:** Lowest latency, as reads are served from any replica without coordination.
- **Throughput:** Highest throughput, minimal coordination overhead.
- **Implication:** Best for scenarios where absolute consistency is not required, maximizing performance.

#### **Summary Table**

| Consistency Level    | Latency        | Throughput      | Use Case Example                        |
|--------------------- |---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Strong               | Highest       | Lowest          | Financial transactions                  |
| Bounded Staleness    | High          | Moderate        | Collaborative apps with relaxed ordering|
| Session              | Low           | High            | User profile/data per session           |
| Consistent Prefix    | Low           | High            | Event logging, ordered feeds            |
| Eventual             | Lowest        | Highest         | Social media feeds, cache data          |

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
Choosing a lower consistency level (eventual, session, consistent prefix) reduces latency and increases throughput, but at the cost of weaker consistency guarantees. Higher consistency levels (strong, bounded staleness) increase latency and reduce throughput, but provide stronger data consistency. The optimal choice depends on your application's requirements for consistency versus performance.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114057Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"ded47f57-17f3-4a62-a711-f559832265ee",question:"How does Cosmos DB guarantee low latency at the 99th percentile?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown Cosmos DB guarantees low latency at the 99th percentile through a combination of architectural and operational strategies:

### Limitations of Serverless Mode in Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB's serverless mode is designed for workloads with sporadic or unpredictable traffic, allowing you to pay only for the resources consumed by database operations. However, it comes with several limitations compared to provisioned throughput mode:

1. **Maximum Storage Limit**  
   - Each serverless container or database is limited to **50 GB** of storage.

2. **Throughput Constraints**  
   - Serverless is not suitable for high-throughput workloads. There are **limits on request units per second (RU/s)**, which can impact performance for heavy or bursty workloads.

3. **No Autoscale or Manual Provisioning**  
   - You cannot use **autoscale** or **manually provisioned throughput** with serverless accounts.

4. **Feature Restrictions**  
   - Some features are **not supported** in serverless mode, such as:
     - Multi-region writes
     - Analytical store (for Azure Synapse Link)
     - Continuous backup
     - Dedicated gateway
     - Materialized views

5. **Account and Region Limitations**  
   - Serverless accounts can only be created in **specific Azure regions**.
   - **Multi-region replication** is not supported; serverless accounts are **single-region only**.

6. **Pricing Model**  
   - Costs are based on the **total number of request units (RUs) consumed** and storage used, which may not be cost-effective for consistently high or predictable workloads.

7. **API Support**  
   - Serverless mode is **not available for all Cosmos DB APIs**. For example, it is supported for SQL (Core) and API for MongoDB, but not for Cassandra, Gremlin, or Table APIs.

8. **Latency**  
   - Cold start latency may be higher for infrequent workloads, as resources are not always pre-allocated.

======================================================

Handling large-scale data ingestion in Azure Cosmos DB requires careful planning and the use of best practices to ensure high throughput, low latency, and cost efficiency. Here are key strategies and considerations:

1. **Partitioning Strategy**
   - **Choose an optimal partition key:** Select a partition key that evenly distributes data and workload to avoid hot partitions.
   - **Monitor partition usage:** Use Azure Monitor metrics to track partition throughput and storage.

2. **Throughput Provisioning**
   - **Autoscale throughput:** Use autoscale (formerly "autopilot") to automatically adjust RU/s based on workload.
   - **Manual scaling:** Provision sufficient RU/s to handle peak ingestion rates, and adjust as needed.

3. **Batching and Bulk Operations**
   - **Bulk Executor Library:** Use the Cosmos DB Bulk Executor library or SDK bulk support to efficiently ingest large volumes of data.
   - **Batch inserts:** Group multiple operations into batches to reduce network overhead and improve throughput.

4. **Data Modeling**
   - **Denormalize data:** Store data in a way that minimizes the need for cross-partition queries during ingestion.
   - **Avoid large documents:** Keep document sizes reasonable to optimize performance.

5. **Concurrency and Parallelism**
   - **Parallelize ingestion:** Use multiple threads or processes to write data in parallel, targeting different partitions.
   - **Leverage asynchronous APIs:** Use async SDK methods to maximize throughput.

6. **Handling Throttling (429 Errors)**
   - **Implement retry logic:** Use exponential backoff when handling 429 (Request Rate Too Large) errors.
   - **Monitor and adjust RU/s:** Increase throughput if throttling is persistent.

7. **Data Migration Tools**
   - **Azure Data Factory:** Use ADF for orchestrating large-scale data migrations into Cosmos DB.
   - **Change Feed:** Use the change feed to process and move data incrementally.

8. **Monitoring and Optimization**
   - **Monitor ingestion metrics:** Track RU consumption, latency, and throttling using Azure Monitor.
   - **Optimize indexing:** Customize indexing policies to reduce write costs if certain fields are not queried.

Azure Cosmos DB provides **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** guarantees for transactions within a logical partition. Here’s how it achieves this:

#### 1. **Single-Item Operations**
- Every single-item operation (such as insert, update, delete on a document) is **ACID-compliant** by default.
- These operations are atomic, isolated, and durable, ensuring strong consistency within the item.

#### 2. **Transactional Batches (Stored Procedures and Bulk Operations)**
- **Transactional batch operations** can be performed using stored procedures or the transactional batch API.
- All operations within a batch must target items within the **same logical partition key**.
- The entire batch is executed as a single transaction:
  - **Atomicity:** All operations in the batch either succeed or fail together.
  - **Consistency:** The state is consistent before and after the transaction.
  - **Isolation:** No intermediate state is visible to other operations.
  - **Durability:** Once committed, changes are permanent.

#### 3. **Isolation Level**
- Cosmos DB provides **snapshot isolation** for transactional batches, preventing dirty reads and ensuring repeatable reads within the transaction.

#### 4. **Distributed Transactions**
- **ACID guarantees are limited to a single logical partition.**
- Multi-partition transactions are not natively supported with full ACID semantics, but you can implement eventual consistency or use application-level coordination for cross-partition scenarios.

#### 5. **Consistency Levels**
- Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels (Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, Eventual).
- ACID guarantees are maintained within the chosen consistency level for transactional operations.

**Summary Table:**

| Operation Type                  | ACID Support | Scope                |
|---------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Single-item CRUD                | Yes          | Any partition        |

**Hot partitions** occur when a disproportionate amount of requests (reads/writes) are directed to a small subset of logical partitions. This can lead to:

- **Throughput throttling:** Requests to hot partitions may exceed the provisioned RU/s (Request Units per second) for those partitions, resulting in 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.
- **Increased latency:** Overloaded partitions can slow down response times.
- **Resource underutilization:** Other partitions may remain idle, wasting provisioned throughput.
- **Potential scaling issues:** Hot partitions can limit the ability to scale out effectively, as the bottleneck remains on specific partitions.

---

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Choose an Effective Partition Key**
   - Select a partition key with high cardinality and even value distribution.
   - Avoid keys with skewed access patterns (e.g., \`country\`, \`status\`).

2. **Monitor Partition Metrics**
   - Use Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB metrics to identify partition key distribution and hot partitions.
   - Track metrics like \`Normalized RU Consumption\` and \`Logical Partition Key RU Consumption\`.

3. **Repartition Your Data**
   - If hot partitions are detected, consider redesigning your partition key.
   - Use synthetic or composite keys (e.g., \`userId#orderId\`) to increase cardinality.

4. **Leverage Bulk Operations and Batching**
   - Distribute bulk writes/reads across multiple partition keys to avoid concentrating load.

5. **Implement Data Archiving or TTL**
   - Use Time-to-Live (TTL) to automatically delete old data, reducing the load on hot partitions.

6. **Increase Provisioned Throughput**
   - As a short-term fix, increase RU/s to handle spikes, but this does not solve the underlying partitioning issue.

---

#### Example

Suppose you use \`userId\` as a partition key, and a few users generate most of the traffic. This causes hot partitions. Switching to a composite key like \`userId#timestamp\` can spread the workload more evenly.

---

**Summary:**  
Hot partitions degrade performance and resource efficiency in Cosmos DB. Mitigate them by carefully selecting and monitoring partition keys, redistributing data, and using features like TTL and batching to balance the workload.`,level:"Advanced",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114102Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"ed466051-cc12-4eb0-861c-2b12678a6428",question:"How do you use stored procedures, triggers, and UDFs in Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
## Using Stored Procedures, Triggers, and UDFs in Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB supports server-side programming through **Stored Procedures**, **Triggers**, and **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**, all written in JavaScript. These allow you to encapsulate logic and execute it directly within the Cosmos DB database engine, reducing client-server round trips and enabling transactional operations.

---

### 1. Stored Procedures

- **Definition**: Encapsulate a sequence of operations (CRUD, business logic) that execute atomically within a single partition.
- **Use Cases**: Batch inserts/updates, complex transactions, data validation.
- **Creation**: Register JavaScript code as a stored procedure in a container.

**Example: Registering a Stored Procedure**
\`\`\`javascript
// JavaScript code for a stored procedure
function bulkInsert(docs) {
    var context = getContext();
    var collection = context.getCollection();
    var count = 0;

    if (!docs) throw new Error("No documents provided");

    var docsLength = docs.length;

    function insertDocument(i) {
        if (i >= docsLength) {
            context.getResponse().setBody(count);
            return;
        }

        var isAccepted = collection.createDocument(
            collection.getSelfLink(),
            docs[i],
            function (err, docCreated) {
                if (err) throw err;
                count++;
                insertDocument(i + 1);
            }
        );

        if (!isAccepted) context.getResponse().setBody(count);
    }

    insertDocument(0);
}
\`\`\`

**Register via Azure Portal, SDK, or CLI**.

**Execute via SDK (e.g., Node.js):**
\`\`\`javascript
const { CosmosClient } = require("@azure/cosmos");
const client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, key });
const container = client.database("db").container("container");

const { resource } = await container.scripts.storedProcedure("bulkInsert").execute(
    partitionKey,
    [arrayOfDocs]
);
\`\`\`

---

### 2. Triggers

- **Definition**: JavaScript functions that execute automatically before (**pre-trigger**) or after (**post-trigger**) a document operation (create, update, delete).
- **Use Cases**: Data validation, automatic field population, auditing.
- **Creation**: Register trigger code in the container.

**Example: Pre-Trigger for Validation**
\`\`\`javascript
function validateDocument() {
    var context = getContext();
    var request = context.getRequest();
    var docToCreate = request.getBody();

    if (!docToCreate.name) {
        throw new Error("Document must have a 'name' property.");
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Attach trigger during operation:**
\`\`\`javascript
await container.items.create(
    { id: "1", name: "Item1" },
    { preTriggerInclude: ["validateDocument"] }
);
\`\`\`

---

### 3. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

- **Definition**: Custom JavaScript functions used in SQL queries for computations or transformations.
- **Use Cases**: Custom filtering, string manipulation, calculations.
- **Creation**: Register UDF code in the container.

**Example: UDF to Check String Prefix**
\`\`\`javascript
function startsWith(input, prefix) {
    return input && input.indexOf(prefix) === 0;
}
\`\`\`

**Register and use in a query:**
\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE udf.startsWith(c.name, "A")
\`\`\`

---

### **Key Points**

- All server-side logic is scoped to a single partition key value.
- Register and manage these objects via Azure Portal, SDKs, or ARM templates.
- Use them to optimize performance, enforce business rules, and enable transactional behavior.

## Cost Optimization Strategies for Azure Cosmos DB

Optimizing costs in Azure Cosmos DB requires a combination of architectural choices, configuration tuning, and ongoing monitoring. Here are advanced strategies to help minimize expenses while maintaining performance and reliability:

### 1. **Choose the Right API and Data Model**
- Select the most appropriate API (Core (SQL), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table) for your workload.
- Design your data model to minimize the number of RU/s (Request Units per second) consumed per operation (e.g., avoid large documents, denormalize where appropriate).

### 2. **Provisioned Throughput vs. Serverless**
- **Provisioned Throughput:** Best for predictable, high-volume workloads. Right-size RU/s to match actual usage and avoid over-provisioning.
- **Autoscale:** Use autoscale to automatically adjust RU/s based on workload, paying only for what you use (within a defined range).
- **Serverless:** Ideal for infrequent or unpredictable workloads, as you pay only for consumed RUs.

### 3. **Partitioning Strategy**
- Choose a partition key that evenly distributes data and workload to avoid hot partitions, which can force over-provisioning.
- Monitor partition usage and split or redesign as needed.

### 4. **Optimize RU Consumption**
- Use efficient queries (avoid cross-partition queries, use filters and projections).
- Minimize the number and size of stored items.
- Use indexing policies to include only necessary properties, reducing write and storage costs.
- Use bulk operations where possible.

### 5. **Data Lifecycle Management**
- Implement TTL (Time to Live) policies to automatically delete obsolete data and reduce storage costs.
- Archive cold data to cheaper storage solutions (e.g., Azure Blob Storage).

### 6. **Multi-Region Replication**
- Only enable multi-region writes or reads if required.
- Choose regions close to your users to minimize latency and egress costs.
- Regularly review and optimize the number and location of replicas.

### 7. **Monitor and Analyze Usage**
- Use Azure Cost Management and Cosmos DB metrics to track RU/s consumption, storage, and regional usage.
- Set up alerts for unusual spikes in usage or costs.

### 8. **Optimize Indexing**
- Customize indexing policies to exclude unnecessary properties or paths.
- Use "lazy" or "none" indexing modes for write-heavy workloads where immediate query consistency is not required.

### 9. **Leverage Reserved Capacity**
- Purchase reserved capacity for predictable workloads to receive significant discounts over pay-as-you-go pricing.

### 10. **Review Consistency Levels**
- Use the lowest acceptable consistency level for your application to reduce RU consumption and replication costs.

## 2. How Point-in-Time Restore Works

- With PITR, Cosmos DB automatically maintains a continuous backup of your data.
- You can restore your data to any point in time within the retention period (up to 30 days).

## 3. Restoring Data

- In the Azure portal, go to your Cosmos DB account with PITR enabled.
- Select **Restore** from the menu.
- Choose the desired **timestamp** within the retention window.
- Specify a **new account name** for the restored data (restoration creates a new Cosmos DB account).
- Select the **region** and **resource group** for the new account.
- Review and confirm the restore operation.

## 4. Considerations

- PITR is only available for accounts using the **Continuous backup** policy.
- You cannot restore to the original account; a new account is always created.
- PITR supports all API types (Core (SQL), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table).

## 5. Example (Portal Steps)

1. Go to your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal.
2. Click on **Restore** in the left menu.
3. Select the **restore point** (date and time).
4. Enter the **new account name** and select the **region**.
5. Click **Review + Restore**.

Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-model, globally distributed database service. It supports various APIs to interact with data. Two of the most popular APIs are the SQL API and the MongoDB API. Here’s how they differ:

| Feature                | SQL API                                         | MongoDB API                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Query Language**     | SQL-like query language (Cosmos DB SQL)         | MongoDB query language (JSON-based)             |
| **Protocol**           | Proprietary Cosmos DB protocol                  | Wire protocol compatible with MongoDB           |
| **Client Libraries**   | Azure Cosmos DB SDKs                            | Native MongoDB drivers                          |
| **Data Model**         | JSON documents, containers, databases           | BSON documents, collections, databases          |
| **Indexing**           | Automatic and customizable indexing             | Automatic indexing (with some MongoDB options)  |
| **Use Case**           | Applications designed for Cosmos DB             | Applications migrating from or using MongoDB    |
| **Feature Parity**     | Full Cosmos DB feature set                      | Subset of MongoDB features supported            |
| **Change Feed**        | Supported                                       | Supported (with some differences)               |
| **Transactions**       | Multi-item transactions supported               | Limited transaction support (depends on version)|

**Summary:**
- **SQL API** is best for new applications or those already using Cosmos DB’s native features and query language.
- **MongoDB API** is ideal for applications that already use MongoDB and want to leverage Cosmos DB’s scalability and global distribution without changing their codebase.

To implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure Cosmos DB, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Azure AD Authentication**  
   Ensure your Cosmos DB account supports Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. This allows you to assign roles to Azure AD identities (users, groups, or service principals).

2. **Assign Built-in or Custom Roles**  
   Cosmos DB provides built-in roles such as \`Cosmos DB Account Reader\`, \`Cosmos DB Operator\`, and \`Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor\`. You can also create custom roles with specific permissions (e.g., read, write, delete on certain resources).

3. **Assign Roles to Identities**  
   Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or ARM templates to assign roles to Azure AD identities at the account, database, or container level.

   Example using Azure CLI:
   \`\`\`bash
   az cosmosdb sql role assignment create \\
     --account-name <cosmos-account> \\
     --resource-group <resource-group> \\
     --scope "/dbs/<database>/colls/<container>" \\
     --principal-id <azure-ad-object-id> \\
     --role-definition-id <role-definition-id>
   \`\`\`

4. **Configure Your Application**  
   Update your application to authenticate with Azure AD and obtain an access token. Use the token to access Cosmos DB resources according to the assigned roles.

5. **Monitor and Audit Access**  
   Use Azure Monitor and Activity Logs to track access and changes to RBAC assignments.

This means it does not enforce any schema on the data stored within its containers (collections). Here’s how Cosmos DB handles schema changes:

- **No Schema Enforcement:** You can store documents with different structures (schemas) in the same container. Cosmos DB does not require you to define a schema before inserting data.
- **Flexible Data Model:** You can add, remove, or modify properties in your JSON documents at any time without any impact on the existing data or the need for database migrations.
- **Application Responsibility:** Since Cosmos DB does not enforce schemas, it is up to the application to handle any logic related to schema validation, data consistency, or transformation.
- **Indexing:** Cosmos DB automatically indexes all properties by default, so new properties added to documents are automatically indexed unless you have defined a custom indexing policy.

**Example:**

\`\`\`json
// Document 1
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30
}

// Document 2 (different schema)
{
  "id": "2",
  "firstName": "Bob",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "bob@example.com"
}
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
Cosmos DB allows you to evolve your data model easily by simply inserting documents with new or modified structures. There is no need for explicit schema migrations or updates at the database level.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114164Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"910844e9-037f-4d73-a497-ea824a88de20",question:"What is the purpose of the Cosmos DB Emulator?",answer:"```markdown **Answer:**\n\nThe **Azure Cosmos DB Emulator** is a tool that allows developers to develop and test their applications locally, without needing an Azure subscription or incurring any costs.

To monitor and troubleshoot throttling in Azure Cosmos DB, follow these steps:

## Monitoring Throttling

1. **Azure Portal Metrics**
   - Go to your Cosmos DB account in the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to **Metrics** under the **Monitoring** section.
   - Look for the following metrics:
     - **Total Requests**: Shows the total number of requests.
     - **Throttled Requests**: Indicates the number of requests that were throttled (HTTP status code 429).
     - **Request Units (RU) Consumption**: Helps you see if you are exceeding your provisioned throughput.

2. **Alerts**
   - Set up alerts on the **Throttled Requests** metric to get notified when throttling occurs.

3. **Diagnostic Logs**
   - Enable **Diagnostic Logs** to capture detailed information about requests, including throttled operations.

## Troubleshooting Throttling

1. **Analyze RU Consumption**
   - Check if your workload is exceeding the provisioned RU/s.
   - If so, consider increasing the RU/s or optimizing your queries.

2. **Examine Application Logs**
   - Look for HTTP 429 errors in your application logs.
   - Review the \`x-ms-request-charge\` and \`x-ms-retry-after-ms\` headers in the response to understand the RU cost and recommended retry interval.

3. **Implement Retry Logic**
   - Ensure your application implements exponential backoff retry logic for 429 errors, as recommended by Cosmos DB SDKs.

4. **Optimize Queries and Indexing**
   - Review and optimize queries to reduce RU consumption.
   - Use appropriate indexing policies to minimize unnecessary RU usage.

5. **Partitioning**
   - Check if your data and throughput are evenly distributed across partitions.
   - Hot partitions can cause localized throttling even if overall RU/s is sufficient.

## Summary Table

| Step                  | Action                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitor Metrics       | Use Azure Portal metrics for throttled requests and RU consumption      |
| Set Alerts            | Configure alerts for throttling events                                 |
| Enable Diagnostics    | Capture detailed logs for analysis                                     |
| Analyze RU Usage      | Check if provisioned throughput is sufficient                          |
| Implement Retries     | Use SDK retry policies for 429 errors                                  |
| Optimize Workload     | Tune queries and partitioning to reduce RU usage and avoid hot spots   |

### How Cross-Partition Queries Work

Cosmos DB distributes data across logical partitions using a **partition key**. When you run a query that doesn't specify a partition key value (or the query needs to access data from multiple partitions), Cosmos DB executes the query across all relevant partitions—this is called a **cross-partition query**.

### Steps to Perform a Cross-Partition Query

1. **Write Your Query**  
   Use the SQL API or SDK to write your query as usual. For example:
   \`\`\`sql
   SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = 'active'
   \`\`\`

2. **Enable Cross-Partition Querying**  
   - **Azure Portal**: When using Data Explorer, cross-partition queries are enabled by default.
   - **SDKs**: Set the \`EnableCrossPartitionQuery\` (older SDKs) or \`EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true\` (newer SDKs use this by default) in your query options.

   **Example in .NET SDK v3+**:
   \`\`\`csharp
   var queryDefinition = new QueryDefinition("SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = @status")
       .WithParameter("@status", "active");

   var queryRequestOptions = new QueryRequestOptions
   {
       // PartitionKey = null // Omit or set to null to query across all partitions
   };

   var iterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<MyItem>(
       queryDefinition,
       requestOptions: queryRequestOptions);

   while (iterator.HasMoreResults)
   {
       foreach (var item in await iterator.ReadNextAsync())
       {
           // Process item
       }
   }
   \`\`\`

3. **Consider RU Consumption and Query Performance**  
   - Cross-partition queries can be more expensive and slower because they scan multiple partitions.
   - Use filters that can reduce the number of partitions scanned.
   - If possible, include the partition key in your query to limit the scope.

4. **Handle Pagination**  
   Results are paginated. Use continuation tokens provided by the SDK to retrieve all results.

### Best Practices

- **Design your partition key** to minimize the need for cross-partition queries.
- **Use filters** that can help Cosmos DB quickly eliminate partitions that don't contain relevant data.
- **Monitor RU usage** to optimize query cost.

**Summary:**  
To perform cross-partition queries in Cosmos DB, simply run your query without specifying a partition key. Ensure your SDK or tool supports cross-partition queries, and be mindful of the potential performance and cost implications.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114207Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"562cb571-68dc-454b-ba78-1e21602e8b62",question:"What is the role of indexing policy in Cosmos DB?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

In Azure Cosmos DB, the **indexing policy** determines how data is indexed within a container. Its primary role is to define which properties of documents are indexed, the types of indexes used (e.g., range, spatial), and how queries are optimized for performance and cost.

Key points about indexing policy in Cosmos DB:

- **Automatic Indexing:** By default, Cosmos DB automatically indexes all properties of documents, enabling fast and efficient queries without requiring manual index management.
- **Custom Indexing:** You can customize the indexing policy to include or exclude specific properties, or to change the index types, which can help reduce storage costs and improve write performance.
- **Query Optimization:** The indexing policy directly impacts query performance. Well-designed policies ensure that queries are served efficiently, while unnecessary indexes can be removed to optimize resource usage.
- **Consistency and Flexibility:** Indexing policies can be changed at any time, and Cosmos DB will automatically update the indexes in the background without downtime.

**Example:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "indexingMode": "consistent",
  "includedPaths": [
    { "path": "/*" }
  ],
  "excludedPaths": [
    { "path": "/nonIndexedProperty/*" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
The indexing policy in Cosmos DB controls how and what data is indexed, directly affecting query performance, storage costs, and overall efficiency of the database. Customizing the policy allows you to tailor indexing to your application's specific needs.`,level:"Intermediate",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114216Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"},{id:"e01bc008-3029-435e-acd1-06616ba9c4c5",question:"How can you use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown You can use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed to automatically process and react to changes (inserts and updates) in your Cosmos DB containers. Here’s how you can set this up:

## Steps to Use Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Change Feed

1. **Create an Azure Function App**  
   In the Azure Portal, create a new Function App or use an existing one.

2. **Add a Cosmos DB Triggered Function**  
   When adding a new function, choose the **Azure Cosmos DB trigger** template. This trigger listens to the Change Feed of a specified Cosmos DB container.

3. **Configure the Trigger**  
   You’ll need to provide:
   - **Cosmos DB connection string** (or use a managed identity)
   - **Database name**
   - **Container name**
   - **Lease container name** (a separate container to track progress)
   - **Other optional settings** (like start from beginning, max items per invocation, etc.)

   Example function signature in C#:
   \`\`\`csharp
   public static void Run(
       [CosmosDBTrigger(
           databaseName: "MyDatabase",
           containerName: "MyContainer",
           Connection = "CosmosDBConnection",
           LeaseContainerName = "leases",
           CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true)] IReadOnlyList<Document> input,
       ILogger log)
   {
       foreach (var doc in input)
       {
           log.LogInformation($"Document modified: {doc}");
       }
   }
   \`\`\`

4. **Process the Changes**  
   The function receives a batch of changed documents (inserts and updates). You can add your custom logic to process these changes, such as updating other systems, sending notifications, or data transformation.

5. **Deploy and Monitor**  
   Deploy your function and monitor its execution using Azure Monitor or Application Insights.

## Key Points

- **Change Feed** provides a persistent log of changes in your Cosmos DB container.
- **Azure Functions** with the Cosmos DB trigger automatically scale and process changes in near real-time.
- **Lease Container** is required to track which changes have been processed, supporting scale-out and checkpointing.

| Feature                      | Azure Cosmos DB                                      | Azure Table Storage                        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Data Model**               | Multi-model (supports document, key-value, graph, column-family, etc.) | Key-value (Table storage only)             |
| **Global Distribution**      | Yes, with multi-region replication and automatic failover | No, single region or manual geo-redundancy |
| **Consistency Levels**       | Five options: Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, Eventual | Eventual consistency only                  |
| **Performance**              | Low latency, high throughput, SLA-backed            | Good for basic workloads, no SLAs for latency or throughput |
| **Scalability**              | Automatic and elastic scaling of throughput and storage | Manual partitioning, limited scalability   |
| **Indexing**                 | Automatic and customizable indexing                 | Limited, only primary key is indexed       |
| **API Support**              | Multiple APIs (SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table) | Table API only                             |
| **SLAs**                     | Comprehensive SLAs (availability, throughput, latency, consistency) | Limited SLAs (availability only)           |
| **Pricing**                  | Higher, based on provisioned throughput and storage | Lower, based on storage used               |

**Summary:**  
Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database service with advanced features, while Azure Table Storage is a simpler, cost-effective key-value store suitable for basic scenarios. Cosmos DB offers more flexibility, scalability, and guarantees, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.`,level:"Beginner",created_at:"2025-04-18T02:11:51.114238Z",topic:"952aa40c-b8e1-49ed-9ca8-ca8cf69db1bb"}];export{e as default};
