The main differences between **.NET Standard** and **.NET Core** are:

| .NET Standard | .NET Core |
|---------------|-----------|
| It is a specification (a set of APIs) that all .NET platforms should implement. | It is a cross-platform, open-source runtime for building applications. |
| Used to ensure code compatibility across different .NET platforms (like .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin). | Used to build and run applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS. |
| You cannot run or execute .NET Standard directly; it’s a library target. | You can build, run, and deploy applications with .NET Core. |
| Helps create libraries that work across multiple .NET implementations. | Used for building modern applications, especially web, cloud, and console apps. |

**In summary:**  
- **.NET Standard** defines a set of APIs for code sharing.  
- **.NET Core** is a runtime and framework for building and running applications.  
You use .NET Standard to write libraries that can be used by .NET Core, .NET Framework, and other .NET platforms.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"22211960-e0cf-478b-9c6d-c1e519e4df30",question:"Which operating systems are supported by .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

.NET Core supports multiple operating systems, including:

- **Windows**
- **Linux**
- **macOS**

This cross-platform support allows developers to build and run .NET Core applications on a wide variety of devices and environments.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"6f50762b-6ff6-44e3-811a-7645d648c645",question:"What is the Global Assembly Cache (GAC)?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

The **Global Assembly Cache (GAC)** is a special folder in the Windows operating system used by the .NET Framework to store shared assemblies. Assemblies are collections of compiled code (DLL files) that applications can use. The GAC allows multiple .NET applications on the same machine to share and use the same version of an assembly, helping to avoid conflicts and save disk space.

**Key points about GAC:**

- Only assemblies with a strong name (signed with a unique key) can be stored in the GAC.
- It is mainly used in the .NET Framework (not in .NET Core or .NET 5+).
- The GAC is managed using tools like \`gacutil.exe\` or Windows Explorer.

**Note:**  
.NET Core and later versions (.NET 5 and above) do not use the GAC. Instead, they use different methods for managing dependencies, such as local application folders and NuGet packages.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"4afd1792-9bc7-4684-a87e-8eefb087f4e8",question:"What is the .NET Framework?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown The **.NET Framework** is a software development platform developed by Microsoft. It provides a large library of pre-coded solutions to common programming problems and a virtual machine that manages the execution of programs written specifically for the framework. The .NET Framework primarily supports applications built for Windows, including desktop applications, web applications, and web services.

**Key features:**
- **Common Language Runtime (CLR):** Manages program execution, memory, security, and exception handling.
- **Base Class Library (BCL):** Offers a wide range of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types for tasks like file reading/writing, database interaction, and more.

The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is a core component of the .NET Framework and .NET Core. It acts as a virtual machine that manages the execution of .NET programs. The CLR provides important services such as:

- **Memory management** (including garbage collection)
- **Exception handling**
- **Security**
- **Thread management**
- **Code verification and compilation (Just-In-Time compilation)**

When you write code in a .NET language (like C# or VB.NET), it is compiled into an intermediate language (IL). The CLR then compiles this IL into native machine code and executes it, ensuring that .NET applications run efficiently and securely across different platforms.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"7032ab5d-296e-47df-ab52-c98517a6658a",question:"What is the role of the Base Class Library (BCL) in .NET?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

The **Base Class Library (BCL)** in .NET is a collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide essential functionality for applications. It acts as the foundation for building .NET applications by offering common features such as:

- File and data access
- Collections and data structures
- Input/output operations
- String manipulation
- Networking
- Security
- Threading

Both .NET Framework and .NET Core (now .NET 5 and later) use the BCL to ensure developers have a consistent set of APIs for building applications. By using the BCL, developers can avoid writing common code from scratch and focus on the unique aspects of their applications.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"c75892c2-d0d0-4771-b140-dfe92dbbb367",question:"Explain the concept of managed code in .NET.",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Managed code** in .NET refers to code that is executed by the .NET runtime environment, known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), rather than directly by the operating system. Here’s what this means:

- **Automatic Memory Management:** The CLR handles memory allocation and garbage collection, so developers don’t need to manually manage memory.
- **Type Safety:** The CLR ensures that code only accesses memory it is authorized to, preventing many common programming errors.
- **Security:** Managed code runs in a controlled environment, allowing the CLR to enforce security policies.
- **Cross-language Interoperability:** Managed code can interact with code written in other .NET languages (like C#, VB.NET, F#).

**Unmanaged code**, in contrast, is executed directly by the operating system (like traditional C or C++ code), and developers are responsible for memory management and security.

**Summary Table:**

| Feature                | Managed Code                | Unmanaged Code              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Execution              | By CLR                      | By OS                       |
| Memory Management      | Automatic (Garbage Collected)| Manual                      |

| Language Interoperability | High (within .NET)       | Limited                     |

**Example:**  
C# code compiled and run on .NET is managed code. C++ code compiled to a native executable is unmanaged code.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"632c0ef5-669a-45b2-b43c-cdfa908cfd2c",question:"What is the purpose of the app.config or web.config file in .NET applications?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

The \`app.config\` (for desktop applications) and \`web.config\` (for web applications) files in .NET applications are used to store configuration settings. These XML files allow developers to define settings such as:

- Database connection strings
- Application settings (key-value pairs)
- Logging configurations
- Security settings
- Custom configuration sections

**Purpose:**  
They provide a centralized and easily manageable way to change application behavior without modifying the source code. This makes it easier to update settings for different environments (development, testing, production) and helps keep sensitive information (like connection strings) out of the codebase.

**Example (\`app.config\`):**
\`\`\`xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="AppName" value="MyApp"/>
  </appSettings>
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=server;Initial Catalog=db;Integrated Security=True"/>
  </connectionStrings>
</configuration>
\`\`\`

**Note:**  
In .NET Core and later (.NET 5/6/7+), configuration is typically handled with \`appsettings.json\` and environment variables, but the purpose remains the same: managing application settings outside of code.`,level:"Beginner"},{id:"4e35e3ee-e1e0-42b0-bc1b-87bac93789bf",question:"What is the difference between a class library and an executable in .NET?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Answer:**

In .NET, the main difference between a class library and an executable is their purpose and how they are used:

- **Class Library**  
  - A class library is a collection of reusable code, such as classes, interfaces, and methods.
  - It is compiled into a Dynamic Link Library (**.dll**) file.
  - It cannot run by itself; instead, it is referenced and used by other applications (like executables).
  - Example: A library for math operations that can be used in multiple projects.

- **Executable**  
  - An executable is a program that can be run directly by the operating system.
  - It is compiled into an Executable (**.exe**) file.
  - It contains an entry point (usually a \`Main\` method) where the program starts execution.
  - Example: A console application or a desktop app.

**Summary Table:**

| Feature         | Class Library (.dll) | Executable (.exe)      |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Entry Point     | No                  | Yes (\`Main\` method)    |
| Can Run Directly| No                  | Yes                    |
| Usage           | Referenced by apps  | Runs as an application |
| File Extension  | .dll                | .exe                   |

It provides a central repository for sharing, discovering, and using libraries (called "packages") in .NET projects.

### How NuGet is Used in .NET Projects

1. **Adding Packages:**  
   Developers can add third-party or custom libraries to their projects using NuGet. This is typically done via:
   - Visual Studio’s **NuGet Package Manager**
   - The **Package Manager Console**
   - The \`dotnet\` CLI (for .NET Core and later)

2. **Managing Dependencies:**  
   NuGet automatically handles downloading and referencing all required dependencies for a package.

3. **Updating Packages:**  
   NuGet makes it easy to update packages to newer versions, ensuring your project uses the latest features and security fixes.

4. **Creating and Publishing Packages:**  
   Developers can create their own NuGet packages and publish them to the public [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/) or a private feed for use by others.

### Example: Adding a Package

Using the **.NET CLI**:
\`\`\`bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
\`\`\`

Using **Visual Studio**:
- Right-click the project in Solution Explorer
- Choose **Manage NuGet Packages**
- Search for the package and click **Install**

Garbage Collection (GC) in .NET is an automatic memory management feature that helps developers avoid memory leaks and manual memory deallocation. Here’s how it works:

#### 1. **Managed Heap**
- .NET allocates memory for objects on the managed heap.
- When objects are no longer referenced, they become eligible for garbage collection.

#### 2. **Generations**
- The managed heap is divided into three generations:
  - **Generation 0:** Short-lived objects (e.g., temporary variables).
  - **Generation 1:** Objects that survived one GC cycle.
  - **Generation 2:** Long-lived objects (e.g., static data, application-wide caches).
- New objects are allocated in Generation 0. If they survive a collection, they are promoted to higher generations.

#### 3. **Garbage Collection Process**
- The GC periodically checks for objects that are no longer accessible by any references in the code.
- When memory is low or the heap gets full, the GC runs to reclaim memory.
- The process involves:
  1. **Marking:** Identifying which objects are still in use.
  2. **Sweeping:** Reclaiming memory used by unreferenced objects.
  3. **Compacting:** Rearranging the remaining objects to make the heap contiguous, reducing fragmentation.

#### 4. **Finalization and IDisposable**
- If an object has a finalizer (\`~ClassName()\`), the GC calls it before reclaiming the memory.
- For deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources, implement \`IDisposable\` and use the \`Dispose()\` method.

#### 5. **Differences in .NET Framework vs .NET Core**
- Both use similar GC concepts, but .NET Core has a more optimized and configurable GC.
- .NET Core supports server and workstation GC modes, and can be tuned for high-performance scenarios.

#### 6. **Manual GC Control**
- You can force a collection with \`GC.Collect()\`, but it’s generally discouraged unless necessary.

---

**In summary:**  
Garbage collection in .NET automatically manages memory by tracking object references, reclaiming unused memory, and optimizing heap usage, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than manual memory management.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"b6605038-c8be-4913-961d-6f18ad3b99d3",question:"What are the main application models supported by .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
The main application models supported by .NET Core are:

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. In .NET Core, DI is a first-class citizen and is built into the framework, making it easy to manage dependencies throughout your application.

#### Key Concepts

- **Dependency**: An object that another object depends on.
- **Injection**: The process of providing an object with its dependencies.

#### How DI Works in .NET Core

1. **Service Registration**: Dependencies (services) are registered in the \`IServiceCollection\` within the \`Startup.cs\` file, typically in the \`ConfigureServices\` method.
2. **Service Lifetime**: Services can be registered with different lifetimes:
   - \`Singleton\`: One instance for the entire application.
   - \`Scoped\`: One instance per request.
   - \`Transient\`: A new instance every time it is requested.
3. **Service Resolution**: The .NET Core runtime automatically injects the required dependencies into constructors of classes (like controllers or services) when they are needed.

#### Example

\`\`\`csharp
// Service Interface
public interface IMessageService
{
    string GetMessage();
}

// Service Implementation
public class MessageService : IMessageService
{
    public string GetMessage() => "Hello from DI!";
}

// Registering the service in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMessageService, MessageService>();
}

// Using the service in a controller
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    public HomeController(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var message = _messageService.GetMessage();
        return View("Index", message);
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: Classes depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- **Easier Testing**: Dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced.
- **Centralized Configuration**: All dependencies are configured in one place.

#### Summary

Dependency Injection in .NET Core simplifies the management of dependencies, promotes best practices like loose coupling, and is seamlessly integrated into the framework, making it easy to use in web applications, APIs, and other .NET Core projects.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"e3a8acc8-7e5f-4f4b-bcc5-b639c5f70b07",question:"How do you perform unit testing in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
## How to Perform Unit Testing in .NET Core

Unit testing in .NET Core is straightforward and well-supported. Here’s how you can perform unit testing:

### 1. Choose a Testing Framework

The most popular frameworks for unit testing in .NET Core are:
- **xUnit** (default for .NET Core)
- **NUnit**
- **MSTest**

xUnit is commonly used due to its integration with .NET Core CLI and Visual Studio.

### 2. Create a Test Project

You can create a test project using the .NET CLI:

\`\`\`bash
dotnet new xunit -n MyProject.Tests
\`\`\`

This creates a new xUnit test project. Add a reference to the project you want to test:

\`\`\`bash
cd MyProject.Tests
dotnet add reference ../MyProject/MyProject.csproj
\`\`\`

### 3. Write Unit Tests

Create test classes and methods. For example, using xUnit:

\`\`\`csharp
using Xunit;
using MyProject;

public class CalculatorTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        var result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
        Assert.Equal(5, result);
    }
}
\`\`\`

- \`[Fact]\` denotes a test method.
- \`Assert.Equal\` checks if the result matches the expected value.

### 4. Run the Tests

You can run tests using the .NET CLI:

\`\`\`bash
dotnet test
\`\`\`

This command builds the test project and executes all tests, displaying the results in the console.

### 5. View Results

Test results will be displayed in the terminal or in the Test Explorer if using Visual Studio.

---

**Summary:**  
- Create a test project (e.g., with xUnit).
- Reference your main project.
- Write test methods using assertions.
- Run tests with \`dotnet test\`.

Unit testing in .NET Core is efficient and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and various IDEs.

- **Platform-specific builds:** RIDs enable you to publish self-contained applications for specific platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Dependency resolution:** They help NuGet and the .NET Core runtime select the right native libraries for the target environment.

### RID Examples

| RID                | Description                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| \`win-x64\`          | Windows, 64-bit                  |
| \`win-x86\`          | Windows, 32-bit                  |
| \`linux-x64\`        | Linux, 64-bit                    |
| \`osx-x64\`          | macOS, 64-bit                    |
| \`linux-arm\`        | Linux, ARM                       |

### Usage

You specify RIDs in your project file (\`.csproj\`) or when publishing:

\`\`\`xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
</PropertyGroup>
\`\`\`

Or via the CLI:

\`\`\`bash
dotnet publish -r linux-x64
\`\`\`

RIDs are essential in .NET Core for targeting and deploying applications to specific operating systems and architectures, ensuring the correct native dependencies are included.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"78cfb692-0f99-45ec-9abd-5127af88b1cd",question:"How does cross-platform development work in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown ### How Cross-Platform Development Works in .NET Core

.NET Core is designed from the ground up to be **cross-platform**, enabling developers to build and run applications on multiple operating systems, including **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. Here’s how cross-platform development is achieved in .NET Core:

#### 1. Platform-Agnostic Runtime

- **.NET Core Runtime** is available for all major operating systems.
- Applications target the .NET Standard or .NET Core APIs, which are implemented consistently across platforms.

#### 2. Modular and Open Source

- .NET Core is **modular**, allowing developers to include only the necessary libraries.
- Being **open source**, it receives community contributions and support for various platforms.

#### 3. Development Tools

- Tools like **Visual Studio Code**, **Visual Studio**, and the **.NET CLI** (\`dotnet\`) are available on all supported platforms.
- Developers can write, build, test, and deploy applications from any OS.

#### 4. Platform-Specific Implementations

- When platform-specific functionality is needed (e.g., file system access, OS APIs), .NET Core provides abstractions or conditional compilation using preprocessor directives.
- NuGet packages can provide platform-specific implementations.

#### 5. Deployment Models

- **Framework-Dependent Deployment**: The app relies on a shared system-wide .NET Core runtime.
- **Self-Contained Deployment**: The app includes its own copy of the .NET Core runtime, ensuring it runs the same way on any supported OS.

#### 6. Consistent APIs

- .NET Core implements a large subset of APIs from the .NET Standard, ensuring code compatibility across platforms.

---

**In summary:**  
.NET Core enables cross-platform development by providing a consistent runtime, APIs, and tooling across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Developers can build applications once and deploy them anywhere .NET Core is supported, with minimal or no code changes.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"f8d8aad6-6c58-404d-9585-6129cab7ded8",question:"What is Kestrel in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Kestrel in .NET Core**

Kestrel is a cross-platform, high-performance web server that is included by default with ASP.NET Core applications. It is designed to serve HTTP requests directly and can be used as a standalone web server or in combination with a reverse proxy server (such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache).

**Key Points about Kestrel:**

- **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **High Performance:** Built on top of the libuv library (in earlier versions) and later on managed sockets for efficient I/O operations.
- **Default Web Server:** All ASP.NET Core templates use Kestrel as the default server.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal overhead, making it suitable for microservices and cloud-based applications.
- **Flexible Hosting:** Can be used directly for internal or development scenarios, or behind a reverse proxy for production deployments.

**Typical Usage Example:**

\`\`\`csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
}

public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseKestrel();
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
\`\`\`

**Summary:**  
Kestrel is the web server that powers ASP.NET Core applications, providing fast, reliable, and cross-platform HTTP server capabilities.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"cafddbba-b0dd-4736-8fa6-901eeb2d4cd3",question:"Explain middleware in ASP.NET Core.",answer:`\`\`\`markdown ### Middleware in ASP.NET Core

Middleware in **ASP.NET Core** refers to software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component in the pipeline has the opportunity to:

- Process incoming HTTP requests.
- Decide whether to pass the request to the next middleware.
- Perform actions before and after the next component in the pipeline.

#### How Middleware Works

When an HTTP request arrives at the application, it is passed through a sequence of middleware components. Each component can:

- **Perform operations** on the request (e.g., authentication, logging).
- **Short-circuit** the pipeline and generate a response (e.g., return a 404 error).
- **Call the next middleware** in the pipeline.

#### Example Middleware Pipeline

\`\`\`csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<FirstMiddleware>();
    app.UseMiddleware<SecondMiddleware>();
    app.UseMiddleware<ThirdMiddleware>();
}
\`\`\`

The request flows through \`FirstMiddleware\`, then \`SecondMiddleware\`, and finally \`ThirdMiddleware\`.

#### Built-in Middleware Examples

- **Authentication**
- **Authorization**
- **Static Files**
- **Routing**
- **Exception Handling**

#### Custom Middleware Example

\`\`\`csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Do something before
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Before\\n");

        await _next(context); // Call the next middleware

        // Do something after
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("After\\n");
    }
}
\`\`\`

To use this middleware:

\`\`\`csharp
app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
\`\`\`

#### Key Points

- Middleware are executed in the order they are added.
- Each middleware can modify the request and response.
- Middleware enables a modular and flexible way to handle cross-cutting concerns.

---

**In summary:**  
Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a fundamental concept for building the HTTP request processing pipeline, allowing developers to compose application behavior in a modular and reusable way.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"7eddd771-4a6b-4a7e-a467-638921bcbd32",question:"What is the difference between self-contained and framework-dependent deployments in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown **Difference Between Self-contained and Framework-dependent Deployments in .NET Core**

|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **.NET Runtime**             | Bundled with the application                 | Must be installed on the target machine       |
| **Deployment Size**          | Larger (includes .NET runtime and libraries) | Smaller (only app and dependencies)           |
| **Portability**              | Highly portable; runs anywhere               | Depends on target machine's .NET installation |
| **Updates**                  | App uses its bundled runtime (not auto-updated) | App uses system runtime (can get updates)     |
| **Command to Publish**       | \`dotnet publish -r <RID> --self-contained\`   | \`dotnet publish\` (default)                    |
| **Use Case**                 | When you control the runtime version, or target machines may not have .NET installed | When you want smaller deployments and rely on system .NET |

**Summary:**
- **Self-contained deployments** package the .NET runtime with your app, making it independent of the system's .NET installation.
- **Framework-dependent deployments** rely on the target system having the appropriate .NET runtime installed.

**Example:**

\`\`\`bash
# Self-contained
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained

# Framework-dependent
dotnet publish -c Release
\`\`\`

Choose self-contained for maximum portability, and framework-dependent for smaller size and easier updates.`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"4799b934-c2c3-4d85-8da8-71a080ad4bc7",question:"How do you manage configuration in .NET Core applications?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
In .NET Core applications, configuration is managed using a flexible and extensible system provided by the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration namespace. Here’s how configuration is typically handled:

### 1. Configuration Sources
.NET Core supports multiple configuration sources out of the box, such as:
- \`appsettings.json\` (and environment-specific files like \`appsettings.Development.json\`)
- Environment variables
- Command-line arguments
- User secrets (for development)
- Custom providers (e.g., Azure Key Vault, INI, XML files)

### 2. Configuration Loading
Configuration is usually set up in the \`Program.cs\` or \`Startup.cs\` file using the \`ConfigurationBuilder\`. For example:

\`\`\`csharp
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables();

IConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();
\`\`\`

In ASP.NET Core, this is handled automatically, and you can inject \`IConfiguration\` wherever needed.

### 3. Accessing Configuration
You can access configuration values directly:

\`\`\`csharp
string myValue = configuration["MyKey"];
\`\`\`

Or bind configuration sections to strongly-typed objects:

\`\`\`csharp
public class MySettings
{
    public string Setting1 { get; set; }
    public int Setting2 { get; set; }
}

// In Startup.cs or Program.cs
services.Configure<MySettings>(configuration.GetSection("MySettings"));
\`\`\`

Then inject \`IOptions<MySettings>\` into your classes.

### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration
.NET Core supports environment-based configuration. For example, \`appsettings.Development.json\` will override values in \`appsettings.json\` when the environment is set to Development.

### 5. Reloading Configuration
If \`reloadOnChange\` is set to \`true\` in \`AddJsonFile\`, changes to the configuration file will be picked up automatically at runtime.

---

**Summary:**  
.NET Core uses a provider-based configuration system that supports multiple sources, environment-specific settings, and strongly-typed binding, making configuration management flexible and powerful.

`,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"bd66e448-1d22-4c25-bc57-57dfc0cceed2",question:"How does logging work in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
In .NET Core, logging is built around a flexible and extensible framework provided by the \`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging\` namespace. Here’s how logging works in .NET Core:

### 1. Logging Abstraction

.NET Core provides an abstraction for logging through the \`ILogger\` and \`ILogger<T>\` interfaces. This allows developers to write logging code that is independent of the underlying logging implementation.

### 2. Built-in Providers

.NET Core includes several built-in logging providers, such as:
- **Console** (logs to the console)
- **Debug** (logs to the debug output window)
- **EventSource**
- **EventLog** (Windows only)
- **Azure App Services**, etc.

You can also use third-party providers like Serilog, NLog, or log4net.

### 3. Configuration

Logging is typically configured in the \`Program.cs\` or \`appsettings.json\` file. You can specify log levels, filters, and providers.

**Example (appsettings.json):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Dependency Injection

Logging services are registered with the dependency injection (DI) container by default. You can inject \`ILogger<T>\` into your classes:

\`\`\`csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void DoWork()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Doing work...");
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 5. Usage

You can log messages at different severity levels:
- \`LogTrace\`
- \`LogDebug\`
- \`LogInformation\`
- \`LogWarning\`
- \`LogError\`
- \`LogCritical\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`csharp
_logger.LogWarning("This is a warning message.");
\`\`\`

### 6. Extensibility

You can create custom logging providers by implementing the \`ILoggerProvider\` and \`ILogger\` interfaces.

---

**Summary:**  
Logging in .NET Core is highly configurable and provider-based, making it easy to direct log output to various destinations and control log verbosity via configuration. It is tightly integrated with dependency injection, promoting clean and testable code.

The \`Startup.cs\` file in ASP.NET Core plays a crucial role in configuring the application's request pipeline and services. It defines two main methods:

1. **ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services):**
   - This method is used to register services required by the application, such as Entity Framework, Identity, MVC, and custom services, into the dependency injection (DI) container.

2. **Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env):**
   - This method sets up the HTTP request processing pipeline using middleware components (e.g., routing, authentication, error handling).

**Summary:**  
The \`Startup.cs\` file is responsible for configuring both the services and the middleware that the ASP.NET Core application will use during its lifetime.
\`\`\``,level:"Intermediate"},{id:"507f95d9-632f-4d0c-be00-810ebcf09a36",question:"How do you handle dependency versioning in .NET Core projects?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
In .NET Core projects, dependency versioning is primarily managed through the project file (\`.csproj\`) using the NuGet package manager. Here’s how you handle dependency versioning:

### 1. Specify Versions in \`.csproj\`
You define dependencies and their versions directly in your \`.csproj\` file:

\`\`\`xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
\`\`\`

You can specify:
- **Exact version**: \`Version="1.2.3"\`
- **Minimum version**: \`Version="1.2.3"\` (NuGet will use 1.2.3 or higher, unless restricted)
- **Version ranges**: \`Version="[1.2.3,2.0.0)"\` (1.2.3 up to, but not including, 2.0.0)

### 2. Use of \`global.json\`
For SDK versioning, you can use a \`global.json\` file to pin the .NET SDK version for your project:

\`\`\`json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "7.0.100"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Restore and Lock Files
- **\`dotnet restore\`**: Ensures all dependencies are downloaded at the specified versions.
- **Package lock files**: With NuGet 5.0+ and .NET Core 3.0+, you can enable a lock file (\`packages.lock.json\`) to lock down the exact versions used, ensuring repeatable builds.

### 4. Central Package Management
For large solutions, you can use [Central Package Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/Central-Package-Management) to manage package versions in a single location.

### 5. Handling Conflicts
If multiple dependencies require different versions of the same package, .NET Core uses the highest compatible version by default. You can use binding redirects in .NET Framework, but in .NET Core, this is handled by the runtime.

### 6. Updating Dependencies
Use the following commands to update packages:
\`\`\`bash
dotnet list package --outdated
dotnet add package <PackageName> --version <Version>
\`\`\`

### Summary Table

| Method                      | Purpose                                 |

In .NET, **synchronous** and **asynchronous** programming refer to how tasks are executed, especially when dealing with operations that may take time, such as I/O, network calls, or database access.

---

### Synchronous Programming

- **Definition:** Tasks are executed one after another. Each operation must complete before the next one starts.
- **Blocking:** The calling thread is blocked until the operation finishes.
- **Example:**
    \`\`\`csharp
    // Synchronous file read
    string content = File.ReadAllText("file.txt");
    Console.WriteLine(content); // This line waits until the file is read
    \`\`\`
- **Use Case:** Suitable for quick, simple operations where blocking the thread has minimal impact.

---

### Asynchronous Programming

- **Definition:** Tasks can be executed without waiting for previous operations to complete. The calling thread can continue executing other code while waiting for the operation to finish.
- **Non-blocking:** The calling thread is not blocked; instead, it can perform other work or return control to the caller.
- **Keywords:** Uses \`async\` and \`await\` in C#.
- **Example:**
    \`\`\`csharp
    // Asynchronous file read
    string content = await File.ReadAllTextAsync("file.txt");
    Console.WriteLine(content); // This line runs after the file is read, but the thread was not blocked
    \`\`\`
- **Use Case:** Ideal for I/O-bound or long-running operations, especially in UI or web applications where responsiveness is important.

### Key Differences

| Aspect            | Synchronous                                | Asynchronous                                  |

| Thread Blocking   | Yes                                        | No                                            |
| Responsiveness    | Lower (can freeze UI or block requests)     | Higher (UI remains responsive, better scaling)|
| Complexity        | Simpler                                    | More complex (requires async/await handling)  |
| Resource Usage    | Can tie up threads unnecessarily            | More efficient use of threads                 |

- **Late binding:** Invoking methods or accessing properties without knowing them at compile time.
- **Attribute inspection:** Reading custom attributes for configuration or metadata.
- **Code generation and dynamic proxies:** Creating types or methods on the fly (e.g., using \`System.Reflection.Emit\`).

### Example

\`\`\`csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

public class Example
{
    public void SayHello() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, Reflection!");
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Type type = typeof(Example);
        MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("SayHello");
        object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
        method.Invoke(instance, null); // Outputs: Hello, Reflection!
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Considerations

- **Performance:** Reflection is slower than direct code access due to runtime type discovery and invocation.
- **Security:** Reflection can access private members, so it should be used carefully.
- **Cross-platform:** Reflection APIs are available in both .NET Framework and .NET Core, but some advanced features (like emitting IL) may differ.

---

**In summary:**  
Reflection in .NET enables runtime type inspection and dynamic invocation, making it essential for scenarios like serialization, dependency injection, and frameworks that require metadata-driven behavior.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"7ea8f4f4-7436-4559-94c6-562df88a0d5a",question:"How does Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation work in .NET?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown ### How Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation Works in .NET

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a core feature of the .NET execution model, both in the .NET Framework and .NET Core (now .NET 5/6+). Here’s an advanced overview of how it works:

#### 1. Compilation to Intermediate Language (IL)
- When you build a .NET application, your source code (C#, VB.NET, F#) is compiled by the language compiler into an Intermediate Language (IL), also known as Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).
- This IL is platform-agnostic and stored in assemblies (.dll or .exe files).

#### 2. Execution and the CLR
- At runtime, the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) loads the IL code.
- The CLR is responsible for memory management, security, and execution of .NET programs.

#### 3. JIT Compilation Process
- When a method is called for the first time, the CLR invokes the JIT compiler.
- The JIT compiler translates the IL code of that method into native machine code specific to the underlying CPU architecture.
- The native code is then executed directly by the processor.

#### 4. Caching of Native Code
- Once a method is JIT-compiled, the native code is cached in memory.
- Subsequent calls to the same method use the already-compiled native code, avoiding recompilation overhead.

#### 5. Types of JIT Compilers
- **Standard JIT**: Compiles methods as they are called (default in .NET Framework).
- **Pre-JIT (NGen)**: Ahead-of-time compilation using Native Image Generator (NGen) to produce native images at install time.
- **Tiered Compilation**: Introduced in .NET Core, it starts with a quick, less-optimized compilation and recompiles hot methods with more optimizations as needed.

#### 6. Advantages of JIT Compilation
- **Platform Independence**: IL can run on any platform with a compatible CLR and JIT.
- **Runtime Optimizations**: JIT can optimize code based on the actual runtime environment (CPU, OS, etc.).
- **Security**: JIT compilation allows for runtime security checks and verifications.

#### 7. Differences in .NET Core
- .NET Core (and .NET 5/6+) introduced the **RyuJIT** compiler, which is faster and supports both x64 and ARM architectures.
- .NET Core supports **ReadyToRun (R2R)** images, a form of ahead-of-time compilation for faster startup.

**In summary:**  
JIT compilation in .NET converts IL code to native code at runtime, enabling platform independence, runtime optimizations, and efficient execution. The process has evolved in .NET Core with new compilers and features for improved performance and flexibility.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"8efd7d77-e0b1-472a-b379-e823018238dc",question:"What is Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation in .NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown ### Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation in .NET Core

**Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation** is a process in .NET Core where the application's Intermediate Language (IL) code is compiled into native machine code *before* the application is run, rather than at runtime. This is in contrast to the traditional Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, where IL code is compiled to native code on the fly as the application executes.

#### Key Points about AOT Compilation in .NET Core

- **Performance:** AOT compilation can improve startup performance because the application does not need to spend time compiling IL to native code at runtime.
- **Deployment:** Applications compiled with AOT can be deployed as self-contained executables, which include all necessary dependencies and native code, making them easier to distribute and run on target machines.
- **Platform Support:** AOT is especially useful for platforms where JIT compilation is not allowed or is undesirable, such as iOS (due to security restrictions) or certain embedded environments.
- **Size vs. Speed Tradeoff:** AOT-compiled binaries are often larger than their IL counterparts, but they can start faster and have more predictable performance characteristics.
- **.NET Native and ReadyToRun:** In .NET Core, technologies like **ReadyToRun** and **Crossgen** (and in .NET 5+ with **crossgen2** and **NativeAOT**) are used for AOT compilation. ReadyToRun compiles IL to native code ahead of time, while still allowing some JIT compilation if needed.

#### Example Workflow

1. **Build Application:** You write your .NET Core application as usual.
2. **AOT Compilation:** Use tools like \`dotnet publish\` with the \`--self-contained\` and \`-p:PublishReadyToRun=true\` options, or use NativeAOT for full AOT.
3. **Deployment:** The output is a native executable that can be run directly on the target platform.

#### Benefits of AOT in .NET Core

- **Faster startup times**
- **Reduced memory usage in some scenarios**
- **Improved security (no JIT at runtime)**
- **Better compatibility with restricted environments**

#### Limitations

- **Reflection and dynamic code generation** may be limited or unsupported.
- **Larger binary sizes** due to native code inclusion.
- **Some runtime optimizations** performed by the JIT may not be available.

---

**In summary:**  
AOT compilation in .NET Core is a technique to pre-compile IL code to native code, improving startup performance and enabling deployment scenarios where JIT is not feasible. It is increasingly important in modern .NET (including .NET 5/6/7+) for building fast, portable, and secure applications.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"ad7d85c4-c48c-4843-aff0-f34317988c8d",question:"How do you implement custom middleware in ASP.NET Core?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown
### Implementing Custom Middleware in ASP.NET Core

In ASP.NET Core, middleware are software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. You can implement custom middleware to add your own logic to this pipeline.

#### Steps to Implement Custom Middleware

1. **Create a Middleware Class**

   A middleware class must include:
   - A constructor that takes a \`RequestDelegate\` parameter.
   - An \`Invoke\` or \`InvokeAsync\` method that takes an \`HttpContext\` parameter.

   \`\`\`csharp
   public class CustomMiddleware
   {
       private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

       public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
       {
           _next = next;
       }

       public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
       {
           // Custom logic before next middleware
           Console.WriteLine("Custom Middleware: Before");

           await _next(context); // Call the next middleware

           // Custom logic after next middleware
           Console.WriteLine("Custom Middleware: After");
       }
   }
   \`\`\`

2. **Register the Middleware in the Pipeline**

   Use the \`UseMiddleware<T>\` extension method in the \`Configure\` method of \`Startup.cs\` (or in the builder in .NET 6+ minimal hosting):

   \`\`\`csharp
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();

       // Other middlewares (e.g., routing, endpoints)
   }
   \`\`\`

   Or, with minimal APIs in .NET 6+:

   \`\`\`csharp
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();

   app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

   app.Run();
   \`\`\`

3. **(Optional) Use Extension Method for Cleaner Syntax**

   You can create an extension method for easier registration:

   \`\`\`csharp
   public static class CustomMiddlewareExtensions
   {
       public static IApplicationBuilder UseCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
       {
           return builder.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
       }
   }
   \`\`\`

   Then register it as:

   \`\`\`csharp
   app.UseCustomMiddleware();
   \`\`\`

#### Key Points

- Middleware can perform actions before and after calling the next middleware.
- Middleware must call \`_next(context)\` to pass control to the next component.
- Middleware can short-circuit the pipeline by not calling \`_next(context)\`.

Both .NET Framework and .NET Core use a managed memory model with automatic garbage collection (GC). However, .NET Core introduces several enhancements and differences in memory management compared to the .NET Framework:

---

#### 1. **Garbage Collector Improvements**

- **Server GC Enhancements:**  
  .NET Core provides a more efficient and scalable Server GC, optimized for high-throughput and multi-core environments. It offers better performance for cloud and containerized workloads.

- **Low-Latency Modes:**  
  .NET Core introduces new GC modes, such as **sustained low latency**, which are not available in .NET Framework. These modes help reduce pause times for latency-sensitive applications.

- **Background GC:**  
  .NET Core's background GC is more efficient and is enabled by default, improving application responsiveness.

---

#### 2. **Span<T> and Memory<T>**

- .NET Core introduces \`Span<T>\` and \`Memory<T>\`, which allow for memory-safe, high-performance manipulation of contiguous memory regions (stack or heap) without allocations. This reduces heap allocations and GC pressure, a feature not present in .NET Framework.

---

#### 3. **Resource-Constrained Environments**

- .NET Core is designed to run in containers and microservices, where memory is limited. It provides better control over memory usage, such as limiting GC heap size via environment variables (e.g., \`COMPlus_GCHeapHardLimit\`).

---

#### 4. **Cross-Platform and Modular GC**

- The GC in .NET Core is cross-platform and decoupled from Windows-specific APIs, allowing for optimizations on Linux and macOS.
- The modular design enables faster updates and improvements independent of the OS.

---

#### 5. **Configuration and Diagnostics**

- .NET Core offers more granular GC configuration options via runtimeconfig.json and environment variables.
- Enhanced diagnostics tools (e.g., \`dotnet-gcdump\`, \`dotnet-trace\`) provide deeper insights into memory usage and GC behavior.

---

#### 6. **Performance Optimizations**

- .NET Core includes optimizations such as tiered compilation and ReadyToRun images, which can reduce memory footprint and improve startup performance.

### **Conclusion**

While both platforms use managed memory and garbage collection, .NET Core introduces significant improvements in efficiency, configurability, and support for modern workloads, making its memory management more flexible and performant than that of the .NET Framework.`,level:"Advanced"},{id:"c42e9243-ae59-4b37-860d-fa4183196307",question:"What is the role of the Host Builder in .NET Core applications?",answer:`\`\`\`markdown The **Host Builder** in .NET Core plays a crucial role in the initialization and configuration of applications, especially for web and generic host scenarios. Here’s an advanced overview:

---

## Role of the Host Builder in .NET Core Applications

### 1. **Centralized Application Startup**
The Host Builder (\`HostBuilder\` or \`WebHostBuilder\`) provides a unified way to set up and configure an application's resources, services, and environment before the application starts running.

### 2. **Dependency Injection (DI) Setup**
It configures the dependency injection container, registering services and their lifetimes. This enables constructor injection throughout the application.

\`\`\`csharp
Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
    {
        services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    });
\`\`\`

### 3. **Configuration Management**
The Host Builder loads configuration from various sources (appsettings.json, environment variables, command-line arguments, etc.) and makes it available throughout the application.

\`\`\`csharp
.ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
{
    config.AddJsonFile("customsettings.json", optional: true);
});
\`\`\`

### 4. **Logging Infrastructure**
It sets up logging providers and configuration, ensuring consistent logging across the application.

\`\`\`csharp
.ConfigureLogging(logging =>
{
    logging.AddConsole();
    logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Warning);
});
\`\`\`

### 5. **Environment Awareness**
The Host Builder detects the environment (Development, Staging, Production) and allows environment-specific configuration and behavior.

### 6. **Lifetime Management**
It manages the application’s lifetime, including graceful startup and shutdown, and hooks for handling shutdown events.

### 7. **Hosting Services**
For web applications, the Host Builder configures the web server (Kestrel, IIS, etc.) and middleware pipeline.

\`\`\`csharp
.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
{
    webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
});
\`\`\`

### Creating and Using Custom Attributes in .NET

Custom attributes in .NET allow you to add declarative information to your code elements (classes, methods, properties, etc.) that can be retrieved at runtime using reflection. This is supported in both .NET Framework and .NET Core.

#### 1. **Creating a Custom Attribute**

To create a custom attribute:

- Inherit from \`System.Attribute\`.
- Optionally, define constructors and properties/fields for additional data.

\`\`\`csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method, Inherited = false)]
public class AuthorAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public double Version { get; set; }

    public AuthorAttribute(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
}
\`\`\`

- \`AttributeUsage\` specifies where the attribute can be applied and its behavior.

#### 2. **Applying the Custom Attribute**

You can apply your custom attribute to code elements:

\`\`\`csharp
[Author("Jane Doe", Version = 1.1)]
public class SampleClass
{
    [Author("John Smith", Version = 1.0)]
    public void SampleMethod() { }
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. **Retrieving Attribute Data via Reflection**

You can use reflection to read attribute data at runtime:

\`\`\`csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

Type type = typeof(SampleClass);

// Get custom attributes applied to the class
object[] attrs = type.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AuthorAttribute), false);

foreach (AuthorAttribute attr in attrs)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Class Author: {attr.Name}, Version: {attr.Version}");
}

// Get custom attributes applied to a method
MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("SampleMethod");
attrs = method.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AuthorAttribute), false);

foreach (AuthorAttribute attr in attrs)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Method Author: {attr.Name}, Version: {attr.Version}");
}
\`\`\`

#### 4. **Key Points**

- Custom attributes can be used for metadata, validation, serialization, etc.
- You can restrict attribute usage with \`[AttributeUsage]\`.
- Attributes are accessed at runtime using reflection.
- Works identically in both .NET Framework and .NET Core.

### Difference Between In-Process and Out-of-Process Hosting in ASP.NET Core

**In-Process Hosting:**
- The ASP.NET Core application runs **inside the IIS worker process** (\`w3wp.exe\` or \`iisexpress.exe\`).
- IIS directly loads and executes the ASP.NET Core application via the **ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM)**.
- Requests are handled **without proxying**; IIS and the ASP.NET Core app share the same process.
- **Advantages:**
  - Faster request processing due to no inter-process communication.
  - Lower latency and better performance.
  - Simplified deployment and debugging.
- **Configuration:** Set \`<AspNetCoreHostingModel>InProcess</AspNetCoreHostingModel>\` in the project file.

**Out-of-Process Hosting:**
- The ASP.NET Core application runs in a **separate process** (typically \`dotnet.exe\`).
- IIS acts as a **reverse proxy**, forwarding requests to the Kestrel server running the app.
- Communication between IIS and Kestrel happens over **HTTP** (usually on localhost).
- **Advantages:**
  - Greater flexibility; can host on platforms other than IIS (e.g., Linux with Nginx/Apache).
  - Decouples the web server from the application process.
- **Configuration:** Set \`<AspNetCoreHostingModel>OutOfProcess</AspNetCoreHostingModel>\` in the project file.

**Summary Table:**

| Feature                | In-Process Hosting        | Out-of-Process Hosting      |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Process                | IIS worker process       | Separate \`dotnet.exe\` process|
| Performance            | Higher                   | Slightly lower              |
| Communication          | In-memory                | HTTP (reverse proxy)        |
| Platform               | Windows (IIS)            | Cross-platform              |
| Hosting Model Setting  | \`InProcess\`              | \`OutOfProcess\`              |

### Implementing Cross-Cutting Concerns in .NET Core Applications

Cross-cutting concerns—such as logging, caching, validation, exception handling, and security—are aspects of a program that affect multiple layers or components. In .NET Core, these are typically implemented using the following techniques:

---

#### 1. **Middleware**

- **What:** Middleware are components in the HTTP request pipeline that can inspect, modify, or short-circuit requests and responses.
- **Use Cases:** Logging, exception handling, authentication, request/response modification.
- **Example:**
    \`\`\`csharp
    public class LoggingMiddleware
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
        public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;

        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
        {
            // Pre-processing logic (e.g., logging)
            await _next(context);
            // Post-processing logic
        }
    }
    // Register in Startup.cs
    app.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>();
    \`\`\`

---

#### 2. **Dependency Injection (DI) and Decorators**

- **What:** Register services with DI and use decorators to wrap services with additional behavior.
- **Use Cases:** Caching, validation, logging, authorization at the service level.
- **Example:**
    \`\`\`csharp
    public class LoggingServiceDecorator : IMyService
    {
        private readonly IMyService _inner;
        public LoggingServiceDecorator(IMyService inner) => _inner = inner;

        public void DoWork()
        {
            // Pre-logic
            _inner.DoWork();
            // Post-logic
        }
    }
    // Register decorator in DI container
    \`\`\`

---

#### 3. **Filters (for ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API)**

- **What:** Filters allow code to run before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline.
- **Types:** Action, Authorization, Exception, Resource, and Result filters.
- **Use Cases:** Validation, logging, exception handling, authorization.
- **Example:**
    \`\`\`csharp
    public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter
    {
        public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context) { /* ... */ }
        public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context) { /* ... */ }
    }
    // Register globally or per-controller/action
    \`\`\`

---

#### 4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Libraries**

- **What:** Use third-party libraries (e.g., [AspectInjector](https://github.com/pamidur/aspect-injector), [Castle DynamicProxy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Castle.Core/)) to inject cross-cutting logic at runtime or compile time.
- **Use Cases:** Advanced scenarios where built-in mechanisms are insufficient.

---

#### 5. **Custom Attributes**

- **What:** Define custom attributes and use reflection to apply cross-cutting logic.
- **Use Cases:** Simple validation, metadata-driven behaviors.

### Differences in Threading Models between .NET Framework and .NET Core

#### 1. **Thread Pool Implementation**
- **.NET Framework:**  
  Uses a legacy thread pool implementation that is tightly coupled with the Windows operating system. The thread pool is managed by the \`ThreadPool\` class, and its behavior is influenced by the underlying Windows thread scheduler.
- **.NET Core:**  
  Introduces a new, portable thread pool implementation written in managed code. This thread pool is optimized for cross-platform scenarios and offers improved scalability and performance, especially on non-Windows platforms.

#### 2. **Platform Dependency**
- **.NET Framework:**  
  Threading is heavily dependent on Windows APIs (e.g., Win32 threads), making it less portable and optimized for Windows environments.
- **.NET Core:**  
  Designed to be cross-platform, using platform-agnostic abstractions. On Linux and macOS, it leverages native threading primitives (like pthreads) but manages them through its own runtime abstractions.

#### 3. **Synchronization Primitives**
- **.NET Framework:**  
  Synchronization primitives (like \`Mutex\`, \`Semaphore\`, \`EventWaitHandle\`) are wrappers around Windows kernel objects.
- **.NET Core:**  
  Provides lightweight, managed implementations for many synchronization primitives, reducing reliance on OS-specific kernel objects and improving performance, especially on non-Windows systems.

#### 4. **Async/Await and Task Parallel Library (TPL)**
- **.NET Framework:**  
  Supports \`async\`/\`await\` and TPL, but some features and optimizations (like \`ValueTask\`, improved scheduling) are limited or unavailable.
- **.NET Core:**  
  Enhanced support for asynchronous programming and TPL, including new APIs, better scheduling, and improved performance for async workloads.

#### 5. **Thread Affinity and UI Threading**
- **.NET Framework:**  
  UI frameworks (WinForms, WPF) are tightly coupled with the Windows message loop and require thread affinity (UI components must be accessed from the main thread).
- **.NET Core:**  
  While .NET Core 3+ supports WinForms and WPF on Windows, it also enables cross-platform UI frameworks (like MAUI) that abstract thread affinity, making it easier to write cross-platform UI code.

#### 6. **Garbage Collection and Threading**
- **.NET Framework:**  
  Garbage Collector (GC) is optimized for server and workstation modes but is less efficient in multi-core, high-concurrency scenarios.
- **.NET Core:**  
  GC is redesigned for better scalability and performance in multi-core environments, with features like low-latency GC and improved thread management.
